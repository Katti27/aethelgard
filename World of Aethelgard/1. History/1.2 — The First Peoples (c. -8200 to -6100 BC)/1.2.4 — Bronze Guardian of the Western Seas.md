# **_Varthash, the Verdant Dream — A Young Warden Between Shore and Wild_**

In this age, a young bronze dragon crosses from the **[[Feywild, Plane of Faerie|Feywild]]** into the Material world and settles upon **[[Waveshadow Isle]]**, an island set between **[[The Verdant Heart|the western great forest]]** and **[[Tideshae Isles|the western sea-isles]]**. He is known in these early centuries as **[[Varthash, the Verdigris Nightmare|Varthash, the Verdant Dream]]**—a name earned not through conquest, but through presence: watchful, curious, and unusually willing to be _known_.

Bronze dragons are drawn to coasts and open horizons. Varthash chooses Waveshadow not as a throne, but as a vantage—close enough to forest and isle that he can observe the living world, and distant enough to remain unclaimed by any single kindred.

## **Waveshadow Isle**

Waveshadow’s defining feature is seclusion. Its coves and sea-caves offer hidden approaches and defensible refuge, while its heights provide long sightlines across the western waters and the forested mainland beyond.

Varthash’s lair begins as a place of shelter and study rather than hoard: a secured cavern complex with submerged passages and dry chambers where he keeps objects for their stories—carved stone tokens, worked metal, ritual offerings freely given, and natural relics that hold meaning in the Weave.

## **Temperament and Practice**

Varthash’s defining trait in this era is **sociability without dependence**. He does not isolate like many dragons; he seeks conversation, tests character, and collects understanding as readily as treasure.

Like others of his kind, he learns to take humanoid form when he wants discourse without intimidation. In this age he most often appears as a **coastal [[Druid|warden]]**, a **[[Wayfarer|wayfarer]]** between shore and forest paths, a **[[Druid|druid]]** among western grove-circles, or a **prospector** near dwarven workings—shapes that let him be approached, questioned, and judged by deed and word rather than by scale and shadow.

## **First Contacts**

Varthash’s first relationships form with the elder peoples already present in the west:

- **Wood-elven circles of the [[The Verdant Heart|Verdant Heart]]**, who treat him as a powerful presence to be read carefully—neither spirit nor god, but something older than mortal measure. With them, Varthash learns restraint, boundary-keeping, and the long patience of the forest.

- **Sea-elven kindreds of the [[Tideshae Isles]]**, whose coastal range brings them closest to Waveshadow. With them, Varthash learns the rhythms of shore and tide, and the value of vigilance over open water and hidden coves.
 
- **Dwarven clans of the [[Durak-Throndhal, the Gods’ Anvil|central mountains]]**, encountered through overland routes and shared interest in rare stone, metalwork, and the deep character of the world beneath the surface. With them, Varthash develops a respect for craft, oath, and the authority of worked permanence.
 

These ties are not treaties or formal alliances. They are the beginning of a pattern: Varthash becomes a known constant along the western reaches—someone mortals can speak to, bargain with, and sometimes rely upon, if they meet him with honesty and courage.

## **What This Establishes**

With Varthash’s settlement, the western coasts gain something new: an enduring guardian presence that is neither nation nor temple, but still shapes behavior through reputation alone.

- **A place becomes “kept.”** Waveshadow is marked as watched ground, altering how nearby peoples move and contend along the western waters.

- **A model of draconic contact appears early.** Varthash demonstrates that a dragon can be part of mortal memory and diplomacy, not only fear and legend.

- **The west gains a witness.** In later centuries, when events shake the world, the western elder peoples will measure change against what Varthash remembers of how things were.

## **From First Guardian to Elder Wanderings**

Not long after Varthash’s settlement, the elder peoples enter a broad era of movement, testing, and long-form rivalries—recorded in **[[1.2.5 — Elder Wanderings|Elder Wanderings]]**.
