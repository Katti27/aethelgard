# **_High Ice, Old Strength, and the First Thrones of Winter_**

The **[[Giant|giants]]** awaken as the third of the elder peoples of [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]], rising in places defined by scale: high peaks, deep cold, raw stone, and storm-swept height. Their earliest identity is not built around towns or craft, but around **contest, dominance, oath-bond, and the right to rule by strength**.

Giantkind does not awaken as a single unified people. Their kindreds emerge across multiple harsh frontiers — but **only the frost giants consolidate into an enduring realm**, while other giant types remain scattered and local.

## **Awakening Regions**

### **[[Jotunbrud|The Northern Ice-Realm]]**

In the far northern ice and high glacial ranges, **[[Giant|frost giants]]** awaken in numbers great enough to form lasting hosts, claim territory, and enforce hierarchy. This region becomes the only true giant realm: **[[Realm of Jotunbrud]]**.

Here, giant life begins in fortress-halls cut into ice and black stone, with rule established through dominance, ordeal, and sworn submission. **[[Thrym, Lord of the Frost Giants]]** is the dominant divine power of this realm, and the frozen citadel of **[[Norguhal]]** stands as the seat of authority and fear.

Jotunbrud’s earliest structure is simple and absolute:

- **A Frost King** at the apex

- **Jarls and war-leaders** beneath
  
- **Hearth-hosts and raiding bands** bound by oath and necessity

- **Punishment and exile** as the fate of weakness or defiance  

This is giant governance in its most consolidated form: winter made political.

### **Scattered Giant-Kindreds Beyond the North**

Elsewhere in Aethelgard, other giant types awaken in **isolated pockets** rather than a unified realm. These do not form a single kingdom, court, or shared state. They persist as local powers—dangerous, proud, and often solitary.

Common expressions of these scattered kindreds include:

- **[[Giant|Storm giants]]** in remote high coasts and tempest-crowned cliffs, rarely gathering beyond a small circle of retainers.

- **[[Giant|Stone giants]]** in hidden mountain basins and deep crag sanctuaries, avoiding sustained contact with other peoples.
 
- **[[Giant|Hill giants]]** in wild uplands and broken valleys where food is plentiful and law is weak.
 
- **[[Giant|Fire giants]]** near volcanic regions and deep furnaces where ore and heat can be mastered.
 
- **[[Giant|Cloud giants]]** as rare enclaves and wandering sky-holds, encountered only in exceptional circumstances. 

These giant enclaves are real, but **they are not nations**. No single banner binds them, and none rival Jotunbrud’s scale or cohesion.

## **Inherent Giant Nature**

Across all giant kindreds, several traits assert themselves from the beginning:

- **Contest as truth** — status is demonstrated, not claimed.

- **Oath and dominance** — submission is sworn, then enforced.
 
- **Scale of thinking** — giants measure time, distance, and consequence differently than smaller peoples.

- **Pride of place** — a hold is not merely shelter; it is proof of right-to-exist.

These traits do not make giantkind uniform, but they make them predictable in one way: **they do not tolerate being treated as equals by those they consider lesser.**

---

## **First Hosts**

In the earliest age, giant society is organized around **hosts**, not cities:

- **War-bands** that roam, raid, and test borders

- **Hearth-holds** where food, captives, and trophies are kept

- **Champions and oath-sworn** who enforce the will of the strong
  
- **Feud-lines** remembered for generations
 

Among frost giants, these hosts knit together into a realm. Elsewhere, they remain local and intermittent.

## **What This Awakening Changes**

With giantkind awake, Aethelgard gains its first truly overwhelming mortal powers—beings capable of shaping regions by presence alone.

- **The far north becomes claimed territory**, defined by frost-giant rule.

- **Mountain and frontier regions gain apex predators with minds and politics.**
  
- **“Strength as law” becomes a living example** that later peoples will fear, bargain with, or imitate.

## **From High Ice to the Western Seas**

With elves, dwarves, and giants awake, Aethelgard now holds three elder peoples whose paths rarely align—but whose existence reshapes every border they touch. Yet the world’s coasts and sea-lanes remain largely unclaimed by any mortal polity.

That changes when a bronze guardian, **[[1.2.4 — Bronze Guardian of the Western Seas|Varthash, the Verdant Dream]]** takes the western waters for his own.
