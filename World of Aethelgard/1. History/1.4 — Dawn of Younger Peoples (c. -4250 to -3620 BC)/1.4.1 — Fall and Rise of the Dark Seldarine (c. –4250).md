## **_Betrayal Unnamed, Web-Exile, and Whispers in the Deep_**

In the wake of the elder consolidations, elven memory records a fracture not of kingdom or council, but of the divine order itself. What happened is preserved only in shards: an offense against **[[Corellon, the Creator of the Elves|Corellon]]** whose true shape is never agreed upon, a betrayal spoken of without detail, and a judgement delivered with finality.

In the early centuries of this era, **[[Araushnee]]** falls from grace. She is cast out and banished into **[[The Abyss, the Infinite Layers|The Abyss]]**, sealed away in the **Demonweb Pits**—a prison and dominion intertwined. The elves of later ages debate whether her exile was punishment, prevention, or necessity. No single account survives uncorrupted. What endures is the result: a god cast into hunger, solitude, and the long work of becoming something else.

### **The Web in Exile**

The **Demonweb Pits** are not merely a place of confinement. They become a forge of will. In that lightless domain, Araushnee’s identity hardens into a new divinity—one defined by patience, predation, and the geometry of snares. She does not return to the heavens. She builds _downward_.

As her power stabilizes, her attention turns to the mortal plane—not to cities or crowns, but to the hidden arteries of the world: the deep ways beneath stone, the hollows where the sun is a rumor, and the places where fear and secrecy already live.

### **Underdark Reach**

By the middle centuries of the era, Araushnee’s influence begins to press into the **[[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark]]**. It does not arrive as conquest. It arrives as suggestion—subtle pressures in the dark, dreams that repeat with unnatural clarity, and coincidences that stop feeling like chance.

Small shrines appear in forgotten caverns. Old symbols gain new meanings. The deep begins to feel _claimed_ in places, not by armies, but by inevitability—like webbing slowly taking a tunnel.

### **Whispers to the Verdant Heart**

The first mortal listeners are those already inclined toward hidden doctrine and harsher rite: the **[[Shadow Druids]]** of **[[Verdant Heart]]**.

Araushnee’s whispers find receptive ground among dark elven adherents—druids who already believe the wild must be ruled as well as kept, and who accept coercion where others demand consensus. What begins as dream-sign and omen becomes interpretation, then instruction: a new spiritual vocabulary layered onto older night-rites. Across generations, some Shadow circles begin to speak of the world in different terms—less as balance to be maintained, more as a tapestry to be _tightened_.

### **The Breaking of Council Trust (c. –4250 to –3500)**

The Emerald Enclave remains a united institution in these centuries, but unity does not prevent strain—especially when doctrine shifts quietly inside that unity.

Following the earlier **Tensions Within the Enclave Council**, suspicion deepens between wood elven traditionalists and the Shadow circles. Disputes that once ended in precedent now end in silence. Conclaves remain orderly, yet the confidence beneath them erodes: which rites are truly shared, which oaths still mean the same thing, and whether the Enclave’s mandate can survive a faction that believes “balance” sometimes requires domination.

By **c. –3500**, the relationship reaches a boiling point. The Enclave still stands, still speaks with one voice to outsiders—but within, the faultline is real and ready, the final conditions set for the schism that will follow in the next era.

---

### **What This Changes**

By the end of the era, three truths have become difficult to deny:

- A new divine will has secured a foothold in the deep places of the world.

- The **[[Shadow Druids]]** have a source of doctrine beyond the Enclave’s old traditions.

- The **[[Emerald Enclave]]** enters the next age intact, but no longer unquestioned from within.

### **From Falling Gods to Foreign Minds**

As Araushnee’s web takes root beneath stone and tension tightens within elven councils, other intrusions begin to press against Aethelgard from beyond its skies and borders—recorded in **[[1.4.2 — Interplanar Invaders (c. –4122)|Interplanar Invaders]]**.
