## **_A Fleeing Colony, Deep Refuge, and the First Hidden War_**

Long before humanity consolidates, and while the elder polities still treat the deep world as distant hazard, a foreign conflict spills into Aethelgard from beyond the mortal plane.

After a long, protracted war fought across the **[[Astral Plane]]** and the **[[Ethereal Plane]]**, a fractured colony of **[[Illithid (faction)|illithids]]** faces collapse. Pursued, scattered, and near annihilation, they abandon the planar theatre entirely. In **c. –4122**, the survivors force passage into the mortal world—not as explorers, but as refugees with ruthless purpose.

They descend into stone.

A single **[[Nautiloid (Illithid)|nautiloid]]**—badly damaged, half-dead, and driven beyond safe limits—makes the crossing with them. It does not roam the world. It fails in the deep. Its broken hull becomes a hidden reliquary of alien craft and a nucleus around which the colony can endure.

## **The Deep Refuge**

The **[[Mind Flayer (Illithid)|mind flayer's]]** first priority is secrecy. Their second is continuity.

They establish their refuge in reaches of the **[[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark]]** where direction loses meaning—tunnels that fold back on themselves, cavern networks that swallow sound, and deep strata threaded with strange radiance and psionic haze that disrupt ordinary scrying and long-range certainty. Even skilled seekers find their efforts blunted: lines of pursuit break, messages distort, and safe routes shift with the fungal cycles.

From the beginning, the refuge changes the character of nearby depths:

- **Disappearances** among deep-denizens and lone wanderers

- **Silent caverns** where scavengers refuse to feed

- **Unnatural coordination** in creatures that should not move as one

- **Dream-distortions**—night terrors that feel imposed rather than imagined

This is the first sign of a war that does not announce itself.

## **Stasis and Reconstruction**

The colony does not expand quickly. It stabilizes.

Within sealed chambers cut behind false passages, **[[Mind Flayer (Illithid)|mind flayers]]** employ **stasis pods**—pressure-vats and sealed tubes used to preserve bodies, suspend fragile survivors, and keep larval stock and essential thralls viable while the refuge is rebuilt. In these controlled conditions, time becomes a tool: the colony can wait out pursuit, mend hierarchy, and restore capacity without exposing itself to open conflict.

An **[[Elder Brain|elder brain]]** survived the flight as a weakened remnant—kept alive, fed, and slowly restored. The colony’s first centuries are consumed by the work of gathering what is needed: securing hosts and rebuilding the communal mind that binds the scattered illithids into a single, disciplined entity.

## **The First Signs in the Mortal World**

In this era, surface powers do not name the threat. The elder peoples who record the deep at all treat early incidents as misfortune. Vanished scouts, empty tunnels, survivors returned with broken memory and borrowed purpose. The signs take centuries to identify because the colony keeps its footprint small. It avoids attention, favors isolated prey, and learns the deep routes that let it move without being seen.

## **A War That Does Not End (c. –4122 to –3500)**

This incursion becomes a hidden war spanning the era: a conflict fought through silence, misdirection, and selective violence in places no force can easily claim and few witnesses can return unchanged.

By **c. –3500**, the colony remains extant—older, better concealed, and more entrenched than when it arrived. It has not yet resumed the **[[Grand Design]]**, but it has secured what it came for: a deep refuge from which it can persist, plan, and endure into later ages.

## **From Deep Refuge to Deep Pursuit**

The **[[Illithid (faction)|illithids]]** are not the only survivors of that planar war. They are followed—relentlessly—by hunters who understand exactly what an entrenched colony becomes if left unbroken, recorded in **[[1.4.3 — Alien Hunters in the Deep (c. –4122)|Alien Hunters in the Deep]]**.
