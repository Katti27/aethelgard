## **_Dragon Spawn, Divine Patronage, and the First Dragonforged Kindreds_**

In this age the dragonforged awaken—born from dragon eggs shaped by divine rite, their bodies and instincts fused from draconic power and humanoid form. 

In **c. –4057**, the first successful hatchings belong to **[[Kobold|kobolds]]**, brought forth in service of **[[Tiamat, the Dragon Queen|Tiamat]]** and her chromatic children. Their emergence is practical and immediate: hatchers, trappers, tunnellers, and scouts. Over the following decades, other draconic powers answer in kind. **[[Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon|Bahamut]]** and **[[Sardior, the Ruby Dragon|Sardior]]** shape their own children, **[[Dragonborn|dragonborn]]** hatched as purpose-made companions, soldiers, and sworn agents—each lineage carrying a different imprint of duty, temperament, and inheritance.

The dragonforged arise widely across the world, but their earliest concentrations cluster where draconic presence is strongest and long-term broods can be sustained.

## **Hatching Regions**

### **Southeastern Highlands and Forests – Metallic Dragonborn**

For the **metallic dragonborn** it is in the southeastern highlands and the bordering forest-country that they hatch in the greatest number. Their broods-lairs are kept safe through oath and vigilance—places built for continuity, training, and watch. Early metallic custom centers on **discipline, guardianship, and sworn responsibility**, and the first generations are raised to act where a dragon’s full presence is rare: patrolling approaches, defending holdings, and carrying their patron’s will where the matter is below that of draconic intervention.

### **The Northeastern Black Forest – Gem Dragonborn**

Around a high peak in the deep reaches of the northeastern black forest **[[Chornyy Lis, the Black Forest|Chornyy Lis]]**, **gem dragonborn** arise in smaller, more insular concentrations. Their hatch-rites emphasize **control of thought, force of will, and psionic discipline** as much as martial readiness. Where metallic lineages speak in the language of vow and duty, gem lineages tend toward a **honing their psionic powers, a fascination with knowledge and collecting magical artifacts**—a culture shaped by profound intellectual interests and a pervasive sense of aloof individualism.

### **Southern Jungles – Kobolds**

In the southern jungles, kobolds multiply in dense broods in chromatic lairs and hidden hoard-sites. Their society forms around **hierarchy, craft, and survival**: building, trapping, tending, and expanding the defended spaces that keep a dragon’s power anchored in the world. Their struggles are against the jungle itself—predators, rival denizens, disease, flood, and the brutal contest of keeping hatch-sites viable in living green chaos.

## **Inherent Dragonforged Nature**

Across all regions, the dragonforged share traits that remain consistent throughout this age:

- **Brood-forged** — identity begins with clutch and brood, not village or tribe.
    
- **Draconic imprint** — element and instinct surface early, as if remembered rather than learned.
    
- **Purpose-seated culture** — their origin stories emphasize that they were made for a purpose, and they owe the powers behind their making.
    

There is no single dragonforged culture except for the drive to serve: **patronage, duty, and inheritance** form the spine of society, even when individuals strain against it.

## **Early Dragonforged Activity (c. –4057 to –3500)**

### **First Hatchings and Secured Sites (c. –4057 to –3950)**

The earliest generations are small and closely protected: 
- Kobold broods expand quickly where lairs can support them. 
- Metallic brood-sites consolidate in defensible forest highlands. 
- Gem hatch-sites favor high stone places and the isolated woodland quiet.  

Locations all suited to vigilance, concealment, and disciplined training.

### **Broods Expand, Conflict and Curiosity (c. –3950 to –3725)**

During this time period all of the dragonforged see customs harden into expectations: who commands, who guards the clutch, who speaks for the brood, and what duties are assigned from birth. Names and personal deeds do not matter, the clutch remains the first unit of belonging and the first measure of responsibility.

For the gem dragonborn in particular they cross paths with some of the established elder powers. During hunting and logging raids [[Giant|giants]] from the [[Realm of Jotunbrud]] threaten to discover their lairs and hidden brood-sites. The defense is swift and ferocious, the gem dragonborn leaving no survivors. The consequences of their failure would be these brutes discovering a foe they would relish hunting into extinction. 

The [[Mystran Accord]]'s School of Divination warns of a new power rising to their north and mages are sent to investigate. In contrast to the meeting with the giants, the gem dragonborn's psionic instinct tells them that these elves of [[Eyllisett, the Isles of Lore|Eyllisett]] are different. The mages possess magical abilities, artifacts and knowledge that their masters covet. They discern they can acquiring more knowledge and the understanding of reality through long-term peaceful interactions.

### **Local Contact and Regional Pressures (c. –3725 to –3500)**

Metallic dragonborn begin to encounter the earliest human stirrings at the edges of their ranges—they recognize **potential**, **fragility**, **pattern of growth**, **need for guidance**. Their instinct tells them that for humans to truly flourish they will have to be tutored in the ways of Bahamut's wisdom.

Gem dragonborn discern that they can acquiring more knowledge and the understanding of reality through long-term peaceful interactions with the mages of the Mystran Accord.

Kobolds in the **southern jungles** fight for survival and continuity: against great beasts, natural hazards, and rival denizens. They persevere to expand, fortify, and supply the lairs they serve, despite the cruel demands of their chromatic masters.

By **c. –3500**, the dragonforged are no longer isolated curiosities of rare hatchings. They are rooted populations in three distant regions—each shaped by its patronage, its terrain, and the particular dangers that test whether a clutch survives its first century.

## **From Dragonforged Birth to the Next Stirring Peoples**

As lairs take hold and endure, and broods expand, other harsh peoples rise elsewhere and claim broad territories of their own—recorded in **[[1.4.5 — The Wild Marches Take Shape (c. –3980 to –3500)|The Wild Marches Take Shape]]**.

## **_Dragon Spawn, Divine Patronage, and the First Dragonforged Kindreds_**

In this age the dragonforged awaken—born from dragon eggs shaped by divine rite, their bodies and instincts fused from draconic power and humanoid form.

In **c. –4057**, the first successful hatchings belong to **[[Kobold|kobolds]]**, brought forth in service of **[[Tiamat, the Dragon Queen|Tiamat]]** and her chromatic children. Their emergence is practical and immediate: hatchers, trappers, tunnellers, and scouts—small bodies made useful, quickly.

Over the following decades, other draconic powers answer in kind. **[[Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon|Bahamut]]** and **[[Sardior, the Ruby Dragon|Sardior]]** shape their own children, **[[Dragonborn|dragonborn]]** hatched as purpose-made companions, soldiers, and sworn agents. Metallic lineages carry Bahamut’s imprint; gem lineages bear Sardior’s touch—yet both are also bound to local draconic patrons in the mortal world, serving gods beyond the planes and “masters” whose lairs they guard in stone and forest.

The dragonforged arise widely across the world, but their earliest concentrations cluster where draconic presence is strongest and long-term broods can be sustained.

## **Early Dragonforged Activity (c. –4057 to –3500)**

### **First Hatchings and Secured Sites (c. –4057 to –3950)**

The earliest generations are small and closely protected.

Kobold broods expand quickly where lairs can support them, digging out hatch-hollows and trap-runs almost as soon as a clutch can walk. In the southeastern highlands, metallic brood-sites consolidate more slowly—fewer hatchings, heavier training, and a deliberate emphasis on watch and readiness. Far to the north, gem hatch-sites favor high stone places and the isolated woodland quiet, keeping their rites contained and their psionic disciplines private.

Across all three regions, the first priority is the same: secure the clutch, harden the site, and ensure the next hatching survives.

### **Broods Expand, Conflict and Curiosity (c. –3950 to –3725)**

As hatchings continue, customs harden into expectation: who commands, who guards the clutch, who speaks for the brood, and what duties are assigned from birth. Names and personal deeds matter less than function—because the clutch remains the first unit of belonging and the first measure of responsibility.

In the far northeast, gem dragonborn cross paths with established elder powers. During hunting and logging raids, **[[Giant|giants]]** from the **[[Realm of Jotunbrud]]** press southward far enough to threaten hidden lairs and brood-sites. The gem dragonborn answer with swift, controlled violence and ensure the intrusions do not return with knowledge worth carrying. They cannot afford to become a named prey.

Elsewhere in that same period, the **[[Mystran Accord]]** begins to register a new presence to the north. The School of Divination warns of a power rising beyond ordinary wildlife or chance, and small mage parties are sent to test what the visions cannot fully resolve. The gem dragonborn read these visitors differently than they do the giants: the mages carry craft, artifacts, and a kind of structured knowing that their local patrons value. Caution remains, but the first exchanges lean toward observation, measured contact, and long-form learning rather than immediate elimination.

### **Local Contact and Regional Pressures (c. –3725 to –3500)**

In the southeastern highlands, metallic dragonborn begin to encounter the earliest human stirrings at the edges of their ranges. These meetings are small—glimpses, crossings, cautious watch—but they leave an impression: potential paired with fragility, rapid change without long memory, growth without guidance. The metallic lineages do not “adopt” humanity in this age, yet the instinct to oversee and instruct begins to take shape in how they observe, warn off dangers, and mark certain routes as watched rather than contested.

In the far northeast, gem dragonborn continue their careful engagement with select Mystran observers, trading distance for understanding. They discover that knowledge can be acquired without conquest—through patience, pattern, and the slow study of those who also hoard in their own way.

In the southern jungles, kobolds remain locked in a harsher immediacy. Their broods fight for continuity against great beasts, natural hazards, and rival denizens, expanding trap-lines and defended hollows to keep hatch-sites viable. Their world is measured by survival and supply: what the lair demands, what the jungle allows, and what must be taken to keep both satisfied.

By **c. –3500**, the dragonforged are no longer isolated curiosities of rare hatchings. They are rooted populations in three distant regions—each shaped by patronage, terrain, and the particular dangers that test whether a clutch survives its first century.
