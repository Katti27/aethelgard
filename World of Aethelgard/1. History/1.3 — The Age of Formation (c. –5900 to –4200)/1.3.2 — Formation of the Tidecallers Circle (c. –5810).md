## **_Sea-Roots, Living Reefs, and the First Tidekeeper_**

In the western sea-isles, sea-elven kindreds gather into enduring community along reefs, tide-caves, and sheltered deeps. Their stability comes from **current-ways**, **safe coves**, and kinship continuity carried across centuries.

By **c. –5807**, the leading druid councils formalize into a single body: the **[[Tidecallers Circle]]**. The first Archdruid to take the title of **[[Tidekeeper of the Tideshae Isles]]**, **[[Tidekeeper Nymeris Velsune]]**, is chosen to guide policy between circles and preserve the rites that bind community to sea.  

In the same early consolidation, they name their island homes the **[[Tideshae Isles]]**—a shared identity for many reefs and coasts linked by water-roads rather than land paths.

## **Aqua-El Founded (c. –5795)**

**[[Aqua-El, the Coral Haven]]** is established in the harbor-bay **[[Aqualond (Bay)|Aqualond]]** as the **Tidecallers Circle’s** first enduring seat: a reef-and-cliff settlement built to hold council, coordinate the isles’ druid circles, and anchor a shared identity across the Tideshae waters. Its form is deliberately divided between two realms—stone above and sea below—so the city can function as both meeting-place and lived domain. Cliffside keeps and trade terraces are carved into the bay’s high walls beyond storm reach, while submerged council halls and residences are set into sea-caves and lower rock where the **Tidekeeper** and archdruids convene. Around it, reefworks and natural barriers—living coral growth and shaped stone-fingers—serve as the city’s first defenses, turning Aqualond’s approaches into a place the sea itself helps to guard.

## **Varthash and the Isles**

Because **[[Waveshadow Island]]** lies within the Tideshae sphere, the Tidecallers Circle becomes the first polity to develop sustained relations with **[[Varthash, the Verdigris Nightmare|Varthash, the Verdant Dream]]**. Early contact is cautious and formal, shaped by shared concern for the western approaches and the long stability of the Isles.

## **Era Events (c. –5810 to –4200)**

### **The First Reefward Works (c. –5790)**  

Druid circles begin long-form cultivation of additional defensive reef structures—living barriers shaped to blunt hostile approaches and break violent surf before it reaches Aqua-El’s lower ways.  

### **The Current-Speakers (c. –5720)**  

The Circle formalizes the **[[Current-Speakers]]**—tide-diviners and reef-readers who maintain shared current-lore: safe underwater routes through reefs and surgeways, seasonal changes in the deeps, and the signals used to coordinate travel and defense between Tideshae communities.

### **[[Temple of Istishia]] (c. –5040)** 

A grand submerged temple is raised beneath the bay of **Aqualond**: pressure-stone halls and coral-lit chambers dedicated to **[[Istishia, the Water Lord|Istishia]]** as a primary sea-elven power. It becomes the Isles’ greatest site of tide-rites, storm appeasement, and ceremonial safe-passage.

### **Rise of the Sahuagin (c. –4895)**  

Predatory **[[Sahuagin|sahuagin]]** packs begin probing the outer reefs and deeper channels. Raids remain scattered at first, but their frequency and coordination grow over the following centuries. Reports of **[[Sahuagin|malenti]]**—mutated sahuagin that resemble aquatic elves—introduce a new danger: infiltration, sabotage, and misdirection within sea-elven society.

### **The Waveshadow Entente (c. –4685)**

After long pressure in the western waters, the Tidecallers and Varthash formalize a lasting understanding remembered as the Waveshadow Entente. It establishes:

- **Shared coastal warding** across the approaches to Tideshae waters

- **Agreed warning rites**—standard signals of light, current-shift, and druidic call used to summon aid

- **A standing respect of demarcated waters**: the deep approaches to Varthash’s hoard-vault and the Tidecallers’ most sacred deeps are treated as inviolate, with passage requiring explicit leave.

## **From Sea Council to Stone Throne**

With the **Tidecallers Circle** established in the **Tideshae Isles** and bound in unity beneath tide and reef — the clans of **Durak-Throndhal** forge a kingdom beneath crown and stone in **[[1.3.3 — Formation of the Kingdom of Thandralas (c. –5740)|Formation of the Kingdom of Thandralas]]**.
