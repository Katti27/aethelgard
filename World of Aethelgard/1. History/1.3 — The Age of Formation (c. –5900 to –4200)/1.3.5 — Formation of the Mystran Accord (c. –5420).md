## **_Eight Schools, Civic Spellcraft, and the Magistratum_**

Across the northeastern inland isles, high elven mages have practiced for centuries as scattered collectives—tower-scholars, hidden sanctums, and reclusive wardens—linked by correspondence, rare gatherings, and the slow exchange of copied spellwork. Over time, the limits of isolation sharpen: lore is lost to accident, apprentices train unevenly, and the local stability of the **[[The Weave|Weave]]** is threatened when spellwork goes wrong.

By **c. –5420**, the leading collectives commit to permanence. They create **[[Avonnar, the Arcane Citadel]]**, a single seat where instruction can be standardized, dangerous theory contained, and great works pursued without dissolving into rival enclaves. Within Avonnar, they establish the **[[Eight Schools of Magic]]** as institutions—distinct in method and temperament, but bound to shared civic purpose. They name their home **[[Eyllisett, the Isles of Lore]]**.

By **c. –5415**, those same collectives formalize their unity as the **[[Mystran Accord]]**. Governance takes lasting shape: the **[[Magistratum]]** is established as the citadel’s legislative body, with representation tied to the eight schools, and the **[[Council of Avonnar]]** forms as the Principals’ crisis leadership—invoked when the Isles’ stability, Avonnar itself, or the Weave is at stake.

## **Avonnar Founded (c. –5420)**

**[[Avonnar, the Arcane Citadel|Avonnar]]** is founded as a citadel in the older sense of the word: a raised seat of learning and power meant to outlast any one archmage, keeping continuity of knowledge through the ages. It is not a mundane fortress; its safety rests on foreknowledge, wardcraft, and the discipline of the eight schools.

Avonnar’s early shape is institutional and deliberate—school precincts with their own halls, repositories, and auditoriums; a civic forum that houses the Magistratum chamber; wards worked into the foundations against assault, sabotage, theft, and magical intrusion; and restricted, sealed chambers reserved for high-risk research and supervised apprentice practice of destructive magic too volatile for open halls

## **The Principals and the Council**

The first eight Principals take their seats as both archmages and civic heads—each the recognized authority of a school within Avonnar’s government:

- **[[Principal Tanyl Evanara (Abjuration)]]**
- **[[Principal Amlaruil Moonflower (Conjuration)]]**
- **[[Principal Elasha Evanara (Divination)]]**
- **[[Principal Faenor Therindion (Enchantment)]]**
- **[[Principal Alassra Silverhand (Evocation)]]**
- **[[Principal Rennyn Aelorothi (Illusion)]]**
- **[[Principal Pharos Tethir (Necromancy)]]**
- **[[Principal Tyvollus Aluviirsan (Transmutation)]]**

The **[[Council of Avonnar]]** serves as the decisive hand in existential moments; the **[[Magistratum]]** carries the long-form civic authority of the schools through law, doctrine, and precedent.

## **Era Events (c. –5420 to –4200)**

### **The First Magistratum Session (c. –5415)**

The Magistratum convenes for the first time and establishes its foundational precedents: equal representation by school, quorum requirements, and the principle that civic authority flows through institutional practice rather than individual power. The assembly also codifies what spellwork may be performed where: restricted domains for planar workings, sealed chambers for unstable research, and clear penalties for experiments that risk the stability or integrity of the Weave.

### **The Eight School Charters (c. –5403)**

Avonnar adopts the binding **[[Eight Schools of Magic Charter]]** that defines each school’s civic obligations: minimum instruction standards, sanctioned research boundaries, and the obligations owed to the whole when a school’s work risks wider harm.

### **The First Mythal and the Mythallar (c. –5388)**

The eight Principals complete Avonnar’s defining work: the first great **[[Mythal of Eyllisett]]**—permanently shaping the local Weave. At its focus is the **[[Mythal of Eyllisett|Mythallar]]**, a device that draws and channels vast raw magic toward Avonnar—making possible research and sustained workings that no single sanctum could safely maintain.

### **The Mystran Scrolls Compiled (c. –5361)**

Using the power of the Mythallar, the Council of Avonnar creates the **[[Mystran Scrolls]]**—a set of fifty scrolls dealing in fundamental magical theory. Two sets are made, each comprising five chapters of ten scrolls. No destructive spell, not even **[[6. Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]**, can affect the scrolls. They can be physically altered to the point of being unrecognizable, but will always reform themselves in time.

### **Evanara Repository, Library of the Arcane Founded (c. –5338)**

Under **[[Principal Elasha Evanara (Divination)|Principal Elasha Evanara]]**, Avonnar’s archives expand into a true institutional library, the **[[Evanara Repository, Library of the Arcane]]**: catalogued, warded, and governed by custodial-librarians. Preservation of knowledge becomes a civic duty of all members of the Mystran Accord.

### **The Moonstars Established (c. –5209)**

Within the School of Illusion, **[[Principal Rennyn Aelorothi (Illusion)|Principal Rennyn Aelorothi]]** forms the **[[Moonstars]]**—an intelligence and counter-manipulation faction tasked with watching for threats that cannot be solved by spellpower alone: infiltration, coercion, and hidden movements against Avonnar or the Accord.

### **The Vaults of Avonnar Constructed (c. –5126)**

**[[Principal Faenor Therindion (Enchantment)|Principal Faenor Therindion]]** oversees the construction of the **[[Vaults of Avonnar]]**—engineered to confine magical artifacts. Avonnar becomes not only a seat of learning, but a place where items too dangerous to circulate can be refused, locked away, and contained.

### **Quess’Ar’Teranthvar Shaped (c. –5062)**
 
**[[Principal Tyvollus Aluviirsan (Transmutation)|Principal Tyvollus Aluviirsan]]** completes **[[Quess'Ar'Teranthvar, the Golden Grove of Hidden Knowledge]]** —an extraordinary transmutation-work that binds one set of the **[[Mystran Scrolls]]** into a living, guarded form within Avonnar’s most protected courtyard.

### **Tyvollus Interred in Quess’Ar’Teranthvar (c. –4952)**

At the end of his tenure, **[[Principal Tyvollus Aluviirsan (Transmutation)|Principal Tyvollus Aluviirsan]]** has his body interred within **[[Quess'Ar'Teranthvar, the Golden Grove of Hidden Knowledge|Quess'Ar'Teranthvar]]**. The work becomes more than a repository: it is a watched threshold. Tyvollus’ flesh is held in stasis while his mind remains locked in reverie, a silent warden bound to the grove he created—present as safeguard, warning, and last resort.

### **The First Baelnorn Oaths (c. –4687)**

Under **[[Principal Pharos Tethir (Necromancy)|Principal Pharos Tethir]]**, the Mystran Accord formalizes rites of enduring guardianship: sanctioned undeath undertaken to protect vault, library, mythal, and citadel across spans no mortal administration can reliably hold. Through sanctioned **baelnorn** rites (a lich-form bound to guardianship), Pharos becomes the first **[[Baelnorn]]** of Avonnar—an enduring guardian of the Council of Avonnar.

### **The Neutrality Doctrine Set (c. –4329)**

The Magistratum adopts the Isles’ long stance: the Mystran Accord will not become an arbiter of external rivalries as a default power. Intervention is reserved for threats that endanger the Weave, the stability of the world, or the Isles of Lore themselves.

## **From Arcane Citadel to the Wider Age**

With **[[Avonnar, the Arcane Citadel|Avonnar]]** established, the **[[Mystran Accord]]** formalized, and the **[[Magistratum]]** and **[[Council of Avonnar]]** set as enduring institutions, the elder powers of Aethelgard enter the next phase of history—**[[1.4 — DAWN OF YOUNGER PEOPLES (c. –4200 to –3600)|the dawn of the younger peoples]]**.
