## **_Mithril Oaths, the First Forge-King, and the Mithril Throne_**

Through the early centuries of this era, the clans of **[[Durak-Throndhal, the Gods’ Anvil|Durak-Throndhal]]** deepen their delves and harden their traditions of craft, oath, and defended interior space. Their greatest early catalyst is a metal that changes what dwarves can make—and therefore what they can _hold_.

By **c. –5740**, the strongest clanholds bind themselves into a single kingship: the **[[Kingdom of Thandralas]]**, sworn beneath rune and hammer. The first to bear the title of **[[Forge-King of Thandralas|Forge-King]]** is **[[High King Grimbran Thandralas]]**, the era’s preeminent war-smith and the founding ancestor of the royal line.

## **Khunzar Founded (c. –5730)**

**[[Khunzar, the Hammerhall]]** is carved and crafted as the first royal seat of the **[[Kingdom of Thandralas]]**, set within the volcanic stone and magma-warmed hollows of **[[Durak-Tharum, the Gods’ Forge]]**. Planned as a city of the deep interior, Khunzar is built around controlled geothermal works that feed its forges and hearths, with fortified approaches and warded passages shaped to hold against collapse, siege, and the slow pressures of time. Its design reflects the kingdom’s first assumption of rule: a crown that endures is a crown prepared to be tested.

## **Era Events (c. –5870 to –4200)**

### **Mithril Discovered (c. –5870)**

Delvers strike bright seams of **[[Mithril]]** in the deeper roots of Durak-Throndhal. The ore’s rarity and value reshape inter-clan priorities: claims are formalized, extraction routes guarded, and the best smiths rise rapidly in influence. Over time, the pressure of mithril—its promise and the conflicts it invites—drives the clans toward binding unity under a single crown.

### **Mithril Hall Completed (c. –5710)**

At the city’s heart, the first royal hall is completed: **[[Mithril Hall, Seat of the Forge-King|Mithril Hall]]**, the Forge-King’s throne room, oath-seat, and judgment chamber—set behind rune-worked gates and defended corridors, where fealty is sworn and the kingdom’s early law is spoken aloud.

### **Founding of the Runesmiths Guild (c. –5630)**

The crown charters the **[[Runesmiths Guild]]** to codify rune-craft and regulate the marking of royal works. The Guild standardizes apprenticeships, sets lawful craft-marks, and becomes the authority for binding-runes used in gates, vaults, and deep-wards—ensuring that “rune-work” is not merely skill, but recognized civic power.

### **Adamantine Perfected (c. –5380)**

The Runesmith Guild achieve a stable forging procedure for **[[Adamantine|adamantine]]**, an alloy of adamant, silver, and electrum that demands extreme heat and painstaking precision. Adamant was once treated as a poorly regarded volcanic byproduct, but with the new forging procedure it becomes a crown resource—reserved for deep-gate fittings, royal seals, and works meant to survive conditions that would break ordinary steel.

### **Commission of the Great Forge (c. –5330)**

The demands of adamantine drive Khunzar to undertake its defining civic project: an engineered forge complex built around controlled magma heat and vast draft-shafts, designed to sustain extreme temperatures without compromising the city’s supporting stone. 

### **Completion of the Great Forge (c. –5010)**

The **[[Great Forge of Khunzar]]** is completed: a monumental industrial heart where ore can be smelted at scale and alloys refined with repeatable precision. The surrounding city expands into specialized wards—foundry galleries, store-vaults, smith-halls, and guarded transit ways. Furthermore, the Great Forge’s output expands adamantine use beyond gates and seals into weapons and armor.

### **Discovery of the Underdark (c. –4870)**

As the crown authorizes deeper delves, dwarven miners breach a vast, hostile under-realm later known as the **[[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark]]**. The discovery is not a single cavern but a network of lightless passages and alien ecologies that resist mapping and undermine certainty.

Early losses are often environmental—poisonous fungi blooms, sudden rockfalls, and stretches where the **[[The Weave|Weave]]** behaves thinly or unpredictably, creating dangerous dead-zones for wards and worked magic. Yet denizens soon follow: lurking **[[Cloaker|cloakers]]**, tunneling predators such as **[[Purple Worm|purple worms]]**, and distant, terrifying intelligence—reports of **[[Beholder|beholders]]** and deep entities like **[[Aboleth|aboleths]]** traveling through submerged passages.

The Underdark becomes a new kind of border: not drawn on the surface, but felt beneath every hold.

### **Deepwarden’s Decree (c. –4530)**
 
In response to mounting deep losses and uncontrolled prospecting, the Forge-King establishes the **[[Deepwardens]]** as a crown arm responsible for oversight of sanctioned delves.

- **Restrictions:** Mining and prospecting teams must register routes and objectives with the Deepwardens before entering restricted depths.

- **Enforcement:** Severe penalties are established for breach—banishment, heavy fines, and forced labor in high-risk mines or tunnel works.

- **Purpose:** _“For the safety of the Holds, the prosperity of the Clans, and the glory of the Mithril Throne.”_

The Decree marks a turning point: the kingdom’s wealth now depends not only on what can be found below, but on what must be kept sealed, monitored, and endured.

## **From Stone Throne to Ice Crown**

With **[[Khunzar, the Hammerhall|Khunzar]]** carved into **[[Durak-Tharum, the Gods’ Forge|Durak-Tharum]]** and the **[[Kingdom of Thandralas]]** secured beneath oath and rune, the far north consolidates beneath frost and conquest—recorded in **[[1.3.4 — Formation of the Realm of Jotunbrud (c. –5600)|Formation of the Realm of Jotunbrud]]**.
