## **_Green Law, Council Stewardship, and the First Heartkeeper_**

In the western great forest, elven druid circles already endure as kin-bound communities anchored to grove-sites, seasonal paths, and long-held sacred places. Over time, the circles begin to coordinate more deliberately: shared rites align, boundaries between circle-territories are recognized by custom, and disputes are settled by council rather than isolation.

By **c. –5890**, the leading circles formalize into a single body: the **[[Emerald Enclave]]**. The Enclave is founded around a simple mandate—**the wild must be protected and kept in balance**, and those who scar it must be opposed.

The first to hold the office of **[[Heartkeeper of the Verdant Heart]]** is elected: **[[Heartkeeper Ravensong Nightcloud]]**, a dark elf archdruid whose standing rests on age, rite-mastery, and the ability to hold rival circles to a shared path.

In the same consolidation, the council gives a single enduring name to the forest itself: **[[Verdant Heart]]**.

## **Kymarine Founded (c. –5865)**

**[[Kymarine, the Great Forest City]]** is grown as the Emerald Enclave’s first enduring forest-seat: a council-city built to host conclaves, preserve record, and provide a stable gathering place for the Verdant Heart’s circles under a single mandate. Its earliest shape is practical and ceremonial at once—meeting-groves grown for assembly and rite, wards set around the city’s heart-sites, and marked paths that formalize safe passage between major territories. Its edges are defined as living boundaries—trees, stones, and springs set as markers—so the city remains an extension of the forest’s order rather than a walled imposition upon it.

## **Era Events (c. –5890 to –4200)**

### **The Greenwrit (c. –5835)**

The Enclave establishes a formal body of remembered law: oaths, rights of passage, circle obligations, and rites of restitution. **[[The Greenwrit]]** is maintained by recital and witnessed tradition, treated as binding precedent within the council.

### **The First Circle Conclave (c. –5710)**

Kymarine hosts the first full conclave of the Verdant Heart’s archdruids and circle-speakers under the Heartkeeper’s authority. Council procedure is standardized: who may speak, how disputes are heard, and how rulings are witnessed and recorded.

### **The Wardens of the Green (c. –5525)**

The Enclave formalizes its outer-facing defenders—druidic [[Druid|wardens]], [[Ranger|scouts]], and [[Paladin|oath-sworn protectors]] tasked with responding to breaches of sacred sites, blight-signs, and hostile intrusions into circle lands.

### **Rise of the Shadow Druids (c. –4520)**

A clandestine faction emerges within the Verdant Heart: **[[Shadow Druids]]** who embrace harsher doctrine and coercive rites, gathering in hidden circles and recruiting heavily among dark elven adherents. Their practices emphasize control, fear, and “correction” of other circles by force when persuasion fails.

### **Tensions Within the Enclave Council (c. –4275)**

Council unity frays. Disputes sharpen around the legitimacy of shadow-circle methods, the place of night-rites within shared tradition, and the boundaries of the Heartkeeper’s authority over dissenting circles. Several conclaves end without consensus, and private alliances form inside the wider council.

## **From Forest Council to Sea Council**

As the **[[Emerald Enclave]]** consolidates its stewardship of **[[Verdant Heart|the Verdant Heart]]**, the western sea-isles follow their own path toward formal unity—recorded in **[[1.3.2 — Formation of the Tidecallers Circle (c. –5810)|Formation of the Tidecallers Circle]]**.
