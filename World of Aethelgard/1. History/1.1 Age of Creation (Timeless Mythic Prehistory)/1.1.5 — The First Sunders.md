## _The First Wounds of Reality_

When Aethelgard’s foundations were newly set—[[Plane of Earth|land]], [[Plane of Water|sea]], [[Plane of Air|sky]], and [[Plane of Fire|flame]] no longer shifting as raw turbulence—the world did not remain seamless. The first great fractures appeared: not wars, not mortal calamities, but **Sunders**—mythic ruptures that permanently altered what the world could _connect to_, what it could _contain_, and how it could be _haunted by what is not present_.

Three such wounds are preserved in all later cosmology: **Dreams**, **Stone**, and **Light**.

### **The Sundering of Dreams**

This Sundering breaks the certainty that the waking world is fully sealed. The veil between [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]] and its liminal “between-places” thinned—most strongly where emotion, story, and living magic already ran close to the surface.

What this Sundering established:

- **The Dreaming becomes reachable** — a persistent oneiric expanse where minds can drift beyond the body and touch something outside themselves.

- **The [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] becomes the dream-road** — the first stable pathways for dream-walking, shared dreams, nightmare intrusion, and oneiric messages, because the veil now permits passage along the world’s border-mists.

- **Fey crossings become possible** — in regions where the Dreaming and the world’s living magic resonate, the boundary to the **[[Feywild, Plane of Faerie|Feywild]]** thins into enduring crossings: places where a traveler can step wrong and emerge somewhere that is still “near,” but no longer mortal.

- **Anchor regions of the Dream-scar** — the breach does not spread evenly. Some lands become famous for it. The druidic west and the sea-linked isles carry the clearest scars: the **[[Verdant Heart|Verdant Heart]]** and the **[[Tideshae Isles]]** become lasting touchpoints where dreams, glamour, and sideways paths most often brush the world.

The result is a permanent truth of [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]]: there are places where **sleep is not private**, and places where the world has more doors than it should.

### **The Sundering of Stone**

If Dreams made the world porous sideways, Stone made it vast downward.

This Sundering tore open the deep places and established the world’s enduring Below—not merely caves, but a continuous under-realm with its own geography, distances, and living pressures.

What this Sundering established:

- **The [[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark]] is opened** — the first great vaults, chasms, underways, and deep chamber-seas form in a connected network beneath the world.
 
- **Deep roads exist before any people claim them** — immense passages and fault-veins become traversable routes, later widened, bridged, fortified, and fought over by whatever powers rise below.

- **Heat and pressure are given channels** — volcanic breath, mineral veins, strange airs, and watercourses find enduring paths through the deep, allowing whole ecosystems to exist far from the sun.

After this Sundering, Aethelgard no longer has only “under the ground.” It has the **[[Underdark, the Great Below]]**—a place that can hold civilizations and horrors all of it's own.

### **The Sundering of Light**

This Sundering did not create the **[[Shadowfell, the Plane of Shadow|Shadowfell]]**—its shape already existed as part of the Great Wheel. What changed here was the relationship between the world and its shadow.

Light, shadow, and memory stop behaving as perfectly reliable witnesses. Darkness ceases to be merely absence and becomes something that can cling, echo, and persist in the mortal world.

What this Sundering established:

- **Shadow resonance takes hold** — certain places in Aethelgard begin to “answer” the [[Shadowfell, the Plane of Shadow|Shadowfell]] more strongly than they should, as if the world’s echo has found purchase in the waking realm.

- **Omen becomes possible** — not as clear prediction, but as refraction: symbols, echoes, and impressions that arrive slanted, incomplete, or displaced from their proper context.

- **Light-scars appear** — rare regions where shadows fall wrong, reflections feel delayed, and moments seem to leave lingering imprints, as though the world is remembering itself imperfectly.


After this Sundering, truth remains attainable—but it is no longer guaranteed that sight, shadow, and sequence will agree. This is the earliest root of prophecy’s burden: **visions can be true and still mislead.**

### **A World Marked**

After the First Sunders:

- The world holds sideways crossings through the Dream-veil and the [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] border-mists.

- The world holds a permanent Below: the [[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark's]] full depth and reach.

- The world holds places that echo—where shadow clings, omens surface, and memory can behave like a force.

Aethelgard endures. And it endures with scars—wounds that later ages will mistake for legends, until they walk into one and find it real.

This era gives way to **[[1.2 — THE FIRST PEOPLES (c. –8200 to –6100 BC)|The First Peoples]]**.
