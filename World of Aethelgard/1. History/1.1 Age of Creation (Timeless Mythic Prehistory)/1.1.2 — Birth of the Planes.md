When the three Primordial Currents ceased their formless drift, creation crossed a threshold. Tendencies hardened into boundaries. Boundaries held. And what had been only motion became _places_—vast, enduring realms with laws of their own.

## The First Sundering of Space — Above, Below, Between

The first great act of ordering was not the making of worlds, but the separation of direction.

The **Luminal Spark** rose and thinned, drawing radiance and aspiration upward into the crown of the **Upper Planes**.

The **Tenebrous Deep** sank and thickened, condensing into the fathomless descent of the **Lower Planes**.

Between them, the **Breath of Life** held the tension of balance—neither crown nor pit—until that middle band stabilized as the axis that all other realms could turn around.

From this division, **the Great Wheel** took its shape.

### The Upper Planes — The Realms of Radiance

Where the Luminal Spark gathered, ideals and ordered mercy condensed into enduring heavens:

- **[[Arcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms]]**
- **[[Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens]]**
- **[[Bytopia, the Twin Paradises]]**
- **[[Elysium, the Blessed Fields]]**
- **[[Beastlands, the Happy Hunting Grounds]]**
- **[[Arborea, the Olympian Glades]]**
- **[[Ysgard, the Heroic Domains]]**

---

### The Outlands — The Plane of Balance

At the Wheel’s center, where the Breath of Life held the line between ascent and descent, the **Outlands** settled as the still point of the cosmos.

A broad, neutral expanse, it anchors the spokes of the Great Wheel. Here, extremes soften at the edges of perception, and the plane itself resists being claimed by any single principle. The Outlands are not emptiness—rather, they are _equilibrium made terrain_, the ground that allows all other realms to remain distinct without collapsing into one another.

### The Lower Planes — The Realms of Ruin

As the Upper Realms rose, the Tenebrous Deep coiled downward. Here, structure did not vanish—it twisted.

- **[[Archeron, the Infinite Battlefield]]**
- **[[Baator, The Nine Hells]]**
- **[[Gehenna, The Fourfold Furnaces]]**
- **[[Hades, the Grey Waste]]**
- **[[Carceri, the Tarterian Depths]]**
- **[[The Abyss, the Infinite Layers]]**
- **[[Pandemonium, the Windswept Depths]]**

### Twin Mirrors — Feywild and Shadowfell

While above and below stabilized into opposed crowns, the scars of the First Sunders gave rise to two reflections: not realms of reward or punishment, but echoes—each answering a different fracture in the foundations of reality.

Coalesced where the breach of the **Sundering of Dreams** left the world’s spirit exposed:

- **[[Feywild, Plane of Faerie]]**

Stabilized where the **Sundering of Light** left time and memory heavy:

- **[[Shadowfell, the Plane of Shadow]]**

---

### The Elemental Chaos

Beneath and around the forming Wheel, raw creation still churned. The **Elemental Chaos** remained a storm of contending fundamentals—fire against water, air against earth—without lasting border.

From that turmoil, four anchors distilled into stable immensities:

- **[[Plane of Air]]**
- **[[Plane of Earth]]**
- **[[Plane of Fire]]**
- **[[Plane of Water]]**

---

### The Invisible Roads — Astral and Ethereal

Last arose the spaces _between_ spaces—the mediums that allow separation without severance.

A silver vastness where thought travels without weight, touching every plane:

- **[[Astral Plane]]**

A misted border that clings to the edges of the Material and its reflections:

- **[[Ethereal Plane]]**

Through these two, the Great Wheel became a connected whole rather than scattered realms.

---

### The Great Wheel at Rest

When the planes at last held their shapes—Upper and Lower, the Outlands at the center, the twin mirrors, the elemental anchors, and the unseen roads—the cosmos stood in poised equilibrium.

Above and below. Center and spoke. Reflection and foundation.

This era ends as the planes settle into reliable structure, clearing the path for the **[[1.1.3 — The Shaping of Aethelgard|Shaping of Aethelgard]]**.
