## _Divine Stewardship and the Ordering of the World’s Cycles_

When Aethelgard’s foundations held steady—land, sea, sky, and flame no longer shifting as raw turbulence—the gods assumed stewardship. This was the beginning of divine dominion: not mortal kingship, but the claiming of enduring cosmic offices. Each deity took hold of a principle that would remain embedded in existence thereafter.

No mortal peoples existed yet. There were no temples and no prayers—only the gods establishing the conditions that would make life, history, and meaning possible.

---

### **The Ordering of Sun, Moon, and the Turning Year**

The first great cycles are fixed: day and night, waxing and waning, season and year—so time can be counted and the world can turn without drifting into chaos.

**[[Lathander, the Morninglord]]** kindles the rhythm of dawn and renewal, establishing the returning promise of day.

**[[Selûne, the Moonmaiden]]** sets the measures of the moon and the lawful recurrence of night’s silver cycle.

---

### **Magic, Lore and Fortune**

With the world stabilized, the great forces that govern power, knowledge, and chance are given structure.

**[[Mystra, the Mother of all Magic]]** binds and orders the [[The Weave|Weave]], defining the laws by which magic may be worked, resisted, and learned.

**[[Oghma, Binder of Knowledge]]** establishes the principle of preserved knowledge—speech, memory, inscription, and the endurance of lore.

**[[Tymora, Lady Luck]]** sets fortune’s turning—chance, risk, and the unpredictable grace that bends outcomes away from certainty.

---

### **Shadow, Secrets, and Deception**

Not all that shapes the world is revealed. The unseen, the hidden, and the misdirected take their places as enduring truths.

**[[Shar, Mistress of the Night]]** claims dominion over shadow and loss: darkness, secrets, and the forgetting that unravels what once mattered.

**[[Leira, Lady of Deception]]** claims deception and illusion: masks, misdirection, mutable perception, and the art of making falsehood seem real.

---

### **Death, Endings, and the Passage Beyond**

The boundary between life and what comes after is established as a law of existence, not a mere absence.

**[[Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything]]** claims endings, final record, and the inexorable closure of all things.  

**[[Raven Queen, the Lady of Fates]]** claims the passage of souls and the threshold where lives become memory, legacy, and fate’s completed thread.

---

### **Nature, Hunt, and the Living World**

The world becomes more than terrain. Growth, wild balance, and living appetite take their stations.

**[[Silvanus, the Forest Father]]** lays down the deep continuity of the wild: grove, root, beast, and the long cycles of living things.

**[[Malar, the Beastlord]]** claims the oldest hunger beneath tooth and claw: predation, pursuit, and the merciless truth that life feeds upon life.

---

### **War, Contest, and Mortal Strife to Come**

Conflict becomes more than accident. Battle and trial are established as forces that will shape later ages.

**[[Tempus, Lord of Battles]]** establishes war as a principle—courage, discipline, violence, and the proving of arms.

**[[Kord, the Stormlord]]** claims storm-born strength and contest—might, endurance, and victory earned through trial.

---

### **Justice, Oath, and Rightful Order**

For the world to one day hold civilization, it must hold law—and the binding force of oath.

**[[Tyr, the Even-Handed]]** sets the first principles of justice: judgement, rightful order, and the weight of sworn word.

---

### **Giants and the Old High Powers**

Ancient sovereignties tied to titanic peoples and primal authority take their places.

**[[Annam All-Father]]** claims the first high sovereignty of giantkind: archetype, lineage, and the ordering of giant power.

**[[Stronmaus, the Smiling God]]** claims storm-crowned giant grandeur—hall, hospitality, and thunder-bolstered strength.

**[[Thrym, Lord of the Frost Giants]]** claims winter’s dominion: cold, conquest through hardship, and the iron certainty of frost.

---

### **Forge, Clan, and the Deep Craft**

Stone and metal become more than matter; they become craft, lineage, and the making of wonders.

**[[Moradin, the All-Hammer]]** establishes the sacred law of the forge: making, endurance, kin, and the shaping of civilization from ore and fire.

---

### **Elves and the First High Aesthetics**

The elven spirit is given its first divine shape: beauty, artistry, and the higher patterning of the world.

**[[Corellon, the Creator of the Elves]]** claims elven creation and the first high aesthetics—art, grace, and the exalted shaping of beauty and form.

**[[Lolth, the Dark Mother|Araushnee, the Weaver]] ([[Lolth, the Dark Mother]])** holds the office of the divine weaver: pattern, craft, and the hidden structure beneath elegance and design. (Her later name and the rupture within elven divinity are taken up in [[1.5.1 — Drow Schism Begins]].)

---

### **Orcs, Bloodline, and the War of the Wild**

A harsher inheritance is set into the world: survival through strength, kin through blood, and will through conquest.

**[[Gruumsh, the One-Eye]]** claims the fierce will of orc-kind: conquest, survival, and the refusal to bow.

**[[Luthic, the Cave Mother]]** claims the primal hearth of orc-kind: bloodline, endurance, protection of kin, and the strength that holds a people together.

---

### **Dragons and the Sovereignty of Scales**

The draconic powers take their stations, each embodying a different claim over draconic destiny.

**[[Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon]]** assumes dominion of draconic honor: guardianship, righteous rule, and justice in scale and flame.

**[[Sardior, the Ruby Dragon]]** holds dominion over the **gem dragons** and the neutral mysteries between extremes—**night**, **psionics**, and **secrets** kept from both tyrant and zealot.

**[[Tiamat, the Dragon Queen]]** claims dominion through fear and hoard: tyranny, appetite, and the crown of conquest.

---

### **The Lower Darkness and the Powers That Wait**

Some dominions are patient and dread, rooted in tyranny, abyssal hunger, shadow, and the corruption of life’s boundary.

**[[Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth]]** claims infernal authority: hierarchy, contract, and domination through law.

**[[Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath]]** claims the hunger of undeath: blasphemous immortality and the profanation of death.

---

### **From Dominion to Scar**

With divine domains claimed, the world could endure—but endurance does not mean peace. The next threshold was not new rule, but the **[[1.1.5 — The First Sunders|First Sunders]]** in reality itself.
