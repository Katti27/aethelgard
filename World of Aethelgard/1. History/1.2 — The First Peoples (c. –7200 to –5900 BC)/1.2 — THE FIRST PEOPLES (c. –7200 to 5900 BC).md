## **[[1.2.1 — Awakening of the Elves (c. –8170)]]**

Elves awaken in multiple regions of Aethelgard: the western great forest, the western sea-isles, and the far northeastern isles; early kindreds form enduring sites, kin-circles, and oath-customs.

## **[[1.2.2 — Awakening of the Dwarves (c. –8035)]]**

Dwarves rise within the central mountain roots that will become **Durak-Throndhal, the Gods’ Anvil**; the first hearth-halls and holdfast traditions begin.

## **[[1.2.3 — Awakening of the Giants (c. –7920)]]**

Giants awaken in the far northern ice and high peaks that will become **Jotunbrud**, while other giant kinds persist in isolated pockets across remote highlands and ranges.

## **[[1.2.4 — Bronze Guardian of the Western Seas (c. –7810)]]**

A young bronze dragon later known as **Varthash, the Verdant Dream** crosses into Aethelgard and claims **Waveshadow Isle** as a coastal seat, beginning his long role among the western elder peoples.
