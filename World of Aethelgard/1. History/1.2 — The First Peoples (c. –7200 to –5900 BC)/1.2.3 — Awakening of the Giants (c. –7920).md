## **_The Old High Kindreds, Contest, and Sovereignty of the North_**

The **[[Giant|giants]]** awaken as an elder people defined by strength, hierarchy, and contest. In [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]], the greatest and most continuous giant presence arises in the far north: the **frost giants** who will later form the Realm of **[[Realm of Jotunbrud|Jotunbrud]]**.

Other giant kinds exist in Aethelgard as well, but as **isolated pockets**—remote enclaves in scattered highlands and hard-to-reach ranges—rather than a single unified realm.

### **Awakening Regions**

#### **[[Jotunbrud|Far Northern Ice and Peaks]]**

In the far north, frost giants awaken into a world of ice-fields, storm coasts, and high peaks. Early giant society centers on dominance proven through contest: feats of strength, ritual rivalry, and the authority of those who can command and endure.

The earliest frost-giant activity is territorial and practical: securing winter shelters, controlling passes and coastal approaches, and establishing lasting dominance over their immediate region.

#### **Scattered Giant Pockets**

Beyond the north, smaller giant enclaves exist in separated places—remote and difficult terrain where a giant presence can persist without forming an empire. These pockets do not share a single political identity at this stage; they are simply places where giantkind endures.

### **Inherent Giant Nature**

Across giantkind, awakening comes with enduring traits:

- **Hierarchy and status through strength** — authority is claimed, proven, and maintained.
 
- **Contest as culture** — rivalry is not incidental; it is a defining social mechanism.
 
- **Territorial certainty** — giants mark and defend what they claim, treating dominance as a natural right.

### **Early Giant Activity (c. –7920 to –5900)**

#### **First Dominions (c. –7920 to –7800)**

Frost giants consolidate around the strongest leaders and most defensible sites: high ridges, storm-facing halls, and winter-strong shelters. Early dominance is measured through challenge and victory, with leadership held by proven might.

#### **Feud and Claim (c. –7800 to –7000)**

Rivalries harden into enduring feuds. Borders emerge in the simplest sense: where one host’s authority ends and another’s begins. In scattered pockets beyond the north, small giant enclaves similarly maintain dominance over the harsh terrain they inhabit.

#### **Endurance of the North (c. –7000 to –5900)**

By the end of this era, frost giants have established lasting control across the far north arctic island—stable enough that later formal court-structure can arise from it without requiring a “restart” of giant society.

### **What This Awakening Changes**

With the giants, Aethelgard gains a third elder continuity—one defined by high power rather than subtle endurance:

- **Permanent dominance in the far north**

- **A culture where leadership is tested and visible**

- **A long memory of feud, claim, and sovereignty**

### **From Northern Sovereignty to the Western Seas**

As elder peoples establish their earliest enduring patterns, a new presence enters the western coasts—recorded in **[[1.2.4 — Bronze Guardian of the Western Seas (c. –7810)|the coming of Varthash]]**.
