## **_Ice-Crown, Jarl-Law, and the First Frost-King_**

In the far north, frost giants endure in a country of glacier, sea-ice, and wind-cut highlands. Survival and status are measured in **strength**, **raid-worthiness**, and **victory in contest**. Rule is personal and immediate: jarls gather followers by feats, disputes are settled through challenge, and the strongest leader is the one still standing when the winter is at its worst.

By **c. –5615**, the jarls of the northern holds accept a single high ruler: **[[Frost-King Hyrm]]**, acclaimed as the first **[[Frost-King of Jotunbrud|Frost-King]]**. In the same year, the realm takes its enduring name—the **[[Realm of Jotunbrud]]**—and the giants begin the work that makes their kingship visible in the world.

## **Norguhal Raised (c. –5615)**

**[[Norguhal, the Glacial Fortress]]** is carved into bedrock at the head of **[[Coldridge Valley]]**, becoming **[[Frost-King Hyrm]]’s** seat of power in the same year the ice-crown is taken. Its strength is geography: inland from the coast, high above the valley floor, and approached through narrow ridgeways and choke-points that can be held by a handful of giants against a larger host. From Norguhal, the Frost-King can summon jarls and warbands to the valley-head and drive them outward along the ridges, while the longships and hunting parties that range the **[[Endless Ice Sea]]** sail from scattered shore-settlements beyond the fortress’s shadow.

## **Era Events (c. –5615 to –4250)**

### **Thrym’s Trial on Ysgard (c. –5612)**

Soon after taking the ice-crown, Hyrm is tested by **[[Thrym, Lord of the Frost Giants|Thrym]]**. Hyrm travels to **[[Ysgard, the Heroic Domains|Ysgard]]**, the heroic domain, to face **Surtur**, a fire-giant smith and divine servant of **[[Annam All-Father]]**. Hyrm returns victorious, bearing **[[Gungnir, the Swaying One]]**—a spear of ancient black metal, rune-marked by Thrym, famed for striking true and returning to the wielder’s hand.

### **The Crucible Established (c. –5579)**

Frost-King Hyrm commissions **[[The Crucible]]**, an arena where disputes between jarls and champions are settled by combat **to the death**. Weapon use is accepted as proof of rightful might; artifacts and trophies become political leverage, not scandal.

### **Longships of the Northern Seas (c. –5286)**

Shipwright-halls in the coastal holds refine longship construction for ice water and storm seas. The first great hunts follow: frost-giant crews range into the northern waters to take whales, **[[Leviathan|leviathan]]** carcasses, and **[[Sea Serpent|sea serpents]]**, returning with meat, oil, and trophies that elevate a jarl’s standing.

### **The Omgar Hunts Begin (c. –5144)**

Word spreads of **Omgar**, a legendary sea serpent that haunts the **[[Endless Ice Sea]]**. The creature becomes a generational obsession—hunted by many jarls across decades, surviving ambush after ambush, and turning the sea-serpent hunt into a proving ground for would-be kings.

### **Somkur’s Victory in the Crucible (c. –5065)**

Near the end of his long life, **Frost-King Hyrm** is challenged in **The Crucible** by **[[Frost-King Somkur|Jarl Somkur]]**, a young war-leader with a rising host. Somkur kills Hyrm in open contest and takes the ice-crown. **[[Gungnir, the Swaying One|Gungnir]]** becomes the **Frost-King’s symbol of authority**, claimed as Somkur’s trophy and proof of rightful rule.

### **The Slaying of Omgar (c. –4987)**

With Gungnir in hand, **Frost-King Somkur** leads a focused hunt and finally kills **Omgar**. The serpent’s head is mounted above Somkur’s throne in **[[Norguhal, the Glacial Fortress|Norguhal]]**, and its bones and scales are divided as king-gifts to bind jarls into loyalty.

### **Timber Raids and the Cold Desert Scars (c. –4716)**

Demand for lumber and ship-timber drives expeditions beyond Jotunbrud’s own sparse stands. Giants range to the far northern coasts of the [[Chornyy Lis, the Black Forest|northeastern black forests]] and the [[Maelstrom Archipelago|islands south of Jotunbrud]], stripping swathes of hardy growth. Over time, repeated cutting and trampling leave stretches of exhausted land that settle into **cold desert** scar-zones—windswept, thin-soiled, and slow to recover.

### **Gurgun’s Gambit (c. –4527)**

**[[Frost-King Gurgun|Jarl Gurgun]]**, a seasoned warrior, issues his own challenge in **[[The Crucible]]** and slays **[[Frost-King Somkur]]**. In the duel he is aided by two hard-won trophies: a **[[Belt of Giant Strength|Belt of Storm Giant Strength]]** taken from a defeated storm giant during a timber expedition on the [[Maelstrom Archipelago]], and a **[[Shield of the Silver Dragon|Silver Dragon Shield]]** fashioned from the scales of a great silver sea-serpent. With Somkur dead, Gurgun takes up **[[Gungnir, the Swaying One|Gungnir]]**, symbol of the Frost-King, and inherits the burden of rule beneath the watching ice-crown.

### **Seers of Thrym Formalized (c. –4368)**

Late in the era, frost-giant shamans and battle-clerics consolidate into a recognized priestly faction: the **[[Seers of Thrym]]**. They advise jarls and kings, interpret omens, and sanctify raids and contests with divine rite. Their influence hardens court custom—portents before war, blessing-runes on prows and spearheads, and ritual witness for high challenges in The Crucible.

## **From Ice Crown to Arcane Citadel**

With the **Realm of Jotunbrud** consolidated beneath the ice-crown and **Norguhal** standing as a seat of giant dominion, the [[Eyllisettln, the Isles of Lore|northeastern inland isles]] see a different kind of power take permanent shape—recorded in **[[1.3.5 — Formation of the Mystran Accord (c. –5420)|Formation of the Mystran Accord]]**.
