## **_Dragon Spawn, Divine Patronage, and the First Dragonforged Kindreds_**

In this age, the dragonforged awaken—born from dragon eggs shaped by divine rite, their bodies and instincts fused from draconic power and humanoid form.

In **c. –4057**, the first successful hatchings are **[[Kobold|kobolds]]**, brought forth in service of **[[Tiamat, the Dragon Queen|Tiamat]]** and her chromatic children. Their emergence is practical and immediate: hatchers, trappers, tunnellers, and scouts. Over the following decades, other draconic powers answer in kind. **[[Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon|Bahamut]]** and **[[Sardior, the Ruby Dragon|Sardior]]** shape their own children, **[[Dragonborn|dragonborn]]** hatched as purpose-made companions, soldiers, and sworn agents—each lineage carrying a different imprint of duty, temperament, and inheritance.

All dragonforged serve both **deity and brood-lord**, but that service takes different forms: kobolds labor under chromatic dominion, while metallic and gem dragonborn are raised as sworn retainers—guardians of the brood and its holdings, and warriors when called.

The dragonforged arise widely across the world, but their earliest concentrations cluster where draconic presence is strongest and long-term broods can be sustained.

## **Hatching Regions**

### **Southeastern Highlands and Forests — Metallic Dragonborn**

For the **metallic dragonborn**, the greatest numbers hatch in the southeastern highlands and the bordering forest-country. Brood-sites are kept through oath and vigilance—places built for continuity, training, and watch. Early metallic custom centers on **discipline, guardianship, and sworn responsibility**, and the first generations are raised to act where a dragon’s full presence is rare: patrolling approaches, defending holdings, and carrying their patron’s will in matters beneath draconic attention.

### **The Northeastern Black Forest — Gem Dragonborn**

Around a high peak in the deep reaches of the northeastern black forest **[[Chornyy Lis — Black Forest|Chornyy Lis]]**, **gem dragonborn** arise in smaller, more insular concentrations. Their hatch-rites emphasize **control of thought, force of will, and psionic discipline** as much as martial readiness. Where metallic lineages speak in the language of vow and duty, gem lineages cultivate a sharper inward focus—honing the mind, guarding secrets, and pursuing knowledge and strange curiosities prized by the gem wyrms who patron them.

### **Southern Jungles — Kobolds**

In the southern jungles, kobolds multiply in dense broods around chromatic lairs and hidden hoard-sites. Their society forms around **hierarchy, craft, and survival**: building, trapping, tending, and expanding the defended spaces that keep a dragon’s power anchored in the world. Their earliest enemies are the jungle itself—predators, rival denizens, disease, flood, and the brutal contest of keeping hatch-sites viable in living green chaos.

## **Inherent Dragonforged Nature**

Across all regions, the dragonforged share traits that remain consistent throughout this age:

- **Brood-forged** — identity begins with clutch and brood, not village or tribe.

- **Draconic imprint** — element and instinct surface early, as if remembered rather than learned.
 
- **Purpose-seated culture** — they are raised with roles already implied: guard, serve, build, hunt, witness. 

There is no single dragonforged culture beyond the spine that holds them together: **patronage, duty, and inheritance**—even when individuals strain against the shape of their making.

## **Early Dragonforged Activity (c. –4050 to –3500)**

### **First Hatchings and Secured Sites (c. –4050 to –3950)**

The earliest generations remain small and closely protected. Kobold broods expand wherever lairs can support them, turning ravines, sinkholes, and root-tunnels into defended hatch-ways. Metallic brood-sites consolidate in defensible highland forest, designed for drill, watch, and long continuity. Gem hatch-sites favor high stone places and the isolated woodland quiet, where discipline can be enforced without disturbance and the mind can be trained as carefully as the blade.

### **Broods Expand, Conflict and Curiosity (c. –3950 to –3725)**

As hatchings continue, customs harden into expectations: who commands, who guards the clutch, who speaks for the brood, and which duties are assigned from first breath. Individual renown matters less than the brood—hold the lair, keep the routes, preserve the clutch, obey the call.

During hunting and logging raids, **[[Giant|giants]]** from the **[[Realm of Jotunbrud]]** threaten to discover gem-dragon lairs and hidden brood-sites. The defense is swift and ferocious, and the gem dragonborn leave no survivors. Failure would mean these brutes discovering a foe they would relish hunting into **extinction**—and once the first tale reaches the jarls, the hunt would not end with a single raid.

From far away in **[[Avonnar, the Arcane Citadel|Avonnar]]**, the **[[Mystran Accord]]** begins to register a _draconic_ signature in the northern reaches—an accumulating pattern in augury: repeated dream-images of gem-faceted scale, crystalline firelight, and **ordered** minds. The School of Divination watches by omen and inference, and dispatches small, discreet parties to the _edges_ of the far north—close enough to confirm that something draconic is establishing long-term broods. In time, the mages establish contact with the gem dragonborn, and—using _Comprehend Languages_—a cautious engagement begins. 

### **Local Contact and Regional Pressures (c. –3725 to –3500)**

In the southeastern highlands, metallic dragonborn begin to encounter the earliest human stirrings at the edges of their ranges. These meetings are small—glimpses, crossings, cautious watch—but they leave an impression: potential paired with fragility, rapid change without long memory, growth without guidance. The metallic lineage’s instinct to oversee and instruct—and to pass on Bahamut’s wisdom—begins to take shape.

In the far northeast, gem dragonborn continue their careful engagement with select Mystran observers, **building a deliberate rapport** through patient exchange—information for information, insight for insight—until dialogue becomes routine rather than exception.

In the southern jungles, kobolds remain locked in a harsher immediacy. Their broods fight for continuity against great beasts, natural hazards, and rival denizens, expanding trap-lines and defended hollows to keep hatch-sites viable. Their world is measured by survival and supply: what the lair demands, what the jungle allows, and what must be taken to keep both satisfied.

By **c. –3500**, the dragonforged are established populations in three distant regions—each shaped by its patronage, its terrain, and the particular dangers that test whether a clutch survives its first century.

## **From Dragonforged Birth to the Next Stirring Peoples**

As lairs take hold and broods endure, other harsh peoples rise elsewhere and claim broad territories of their own—recorded in **[[1.4.5 — The Wild Marches Take Shape (c. –3980 to –3500)|The Wild Marches Take Shape]]**.
