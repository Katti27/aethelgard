## **_Betrayal Unnamed, Web-Exile, and Whispers in the Deep_**

In the wake of the elder consolidations, elven memory records a rupture not of kingdom or council, but of the divine order itself. What occurred is preserved only in shards: a revolt within the Seldarine, acts of betrayal against **[[Corellon, the Creator of the Elves|Corellon]]**, and a judgement delivered with finality. Mortal tradition later gives the event a single name—**[[Lolth’s Rebellion]]**—while the true sequence remains the province of myth, omen, and contested divine record.

In the early centuries of this era, **[[Lolth, Queen of Spiders|Araushnee]]** is cast out of **[[Arvandor, the High Forest|Arvandor]]** in **[[Arborea, the Olympian Glades|Arborea]]** and driven into **[[Abyss, the Infinite Layers|the Abyss]]**, her exile ending in the **[[Demonweb Pits, Lolth's Web|Demonweb Pits]]**—a realm of layered web and living snare where dominion and captivity become difficult to separate. From that descent onward, the name _Araushnee_ recedes from common invocation. The world comes to know her as **[[Lolth, Queen of Spiders]]**, and the change in name marks the change in nature: a goddess remade by cruelty, capriciousness, and calculated malice.

### **The Web in Exile**

The **Demonweb Pits** become a crucible of doctrine. In that lightless domain, Lolth’s will refines into a divinity of traps, bargains, and slow coercion—power expressed through leverage rather than proclamation. She builds a spiritual language that treats loyalty as silk-line and fear as anchor-point, and she cultivates worship that spreads by secrecy: first a sign, then a rite, then an oath that cannot be unmade cleanly.

Her attention turns toward the mortal world by degrees, seeking places where secrecy already thrives and where the surface gaze seldom reaches.

### **Underdark Reach**

By the middle centuries of the era, **Lolth’s** influence begins to press into the **[[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark]]**. It arrives as suggestion—subtle pressures in the dark, dreams that repeat with unnatural clarity, and coincidences that stop feeling like chance.

Her foothold takes the shape of _selective presence_: forgotten chambers, abandoned delves, and quiet hollows where no one power maintains lasting control. Small shrines appear in caverns, proclaiming her presence. Isolated deep explorers are plagued by dreams of the same image—silk, eyes, and a patient web. Capricious pacts spread because they _work_, then are withdrawn just as quickly unless they are met with blind obedience.

The Underdark begins to feel _threaded_: not possessed in full, but subtly arranged, as if someone has learned which strands can be pulled without waking the entire deep.

### **Whispers to the Verdant Heart**

Lolth’s first durable mortal listeners are those already inclined toward hidden doctrine and harsher rite: the **[[Shadow Druids]]** of the **[[Verdant Heart]]**.

Her influence finds receptive ground among dark elven adherents—druids who already accept coercion where others insist on consensus, and who are willing to treat “balance” as something enforced rather than negotiated. What begins as omen becomes interpretation, then instruction: a new spiritual vocabulary layered onto older night-rites. Across generations, some shadow circles begin to speak of the world less as a living harmony to be tended, and more as a tapestry to be tightened and held.

### **The Breaking of Council Trust (c. –4200 to –3500)**

The **[[Emerald Enclave]]** remains a united institution in these centuries, yet unity carries strain when doctrine shifts quietly inside it.

Following the earlier **[[1.3.1 — Formation of the Emerald Enclave (c. –5890)|Tensions Within the Enclave Council]]**, suspicion deepens between wood elven traditionalists and the shadow circles. Disputes that once ended in precedent increasingly end in silence. Conclaves remain orderly, but confidence erodes beneath them: which rites remain shared, which oaths still carry the same meaning, and whether the Enclave’s mandate can hold if a faction embraces domination as a sacred tool.

By **c. –3500**, the relationship reaches a boiling point. The Enclave still speaks with one voice to outsiders—but within, the faultline is set and ready, the conditions laid for the schism that will follow in the next era.

---

### **What This Changes**

By the end of the era, three truths have become difficult to deny:

- **Lolth** has established footholds beneath the world, spreading worship through secrecy and leverage.
    
- The **[[Shadow Druids]]** have a source of doctrine beyond the Enclave’s old traditions.
    
- The **[[Emerald Enclave]]** enters the next age intact, yet no longer unquestioned from within.

### **From Lolth’s Rebellion to Foreign Minds**

As **Lolth’s** web takes root beneath stone and tension tightens within elven councils, other intrusions begin to press against Aethelgard from beyond the mortal plane—recorded in **[[1.4.2 — Interplanar Invaders (c. –4122)|Interplanar Invaders]]**.
