## **_Cenobite Outposts, Psionic Discipline, and the Long Pursuit_**

The **[[Illithid (faction)|illithids]]** do not arrive alone. Their flight into the mortal world is pursued by enemies who have spent many years in an interplanar war with them.

In **c. –4122**, the **[[Githzerai]]**—the ascetic, discipline-bound inheritors of **[[Zerthimon, the Prophet-Leader|Zerthimon]]**—follow the **[[Mind Flayer (Illithid)|mind flayers]]** into Aethelgard by the same planar passages and take up the hunt in the **[[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark]]**. Their home plane, **[[Limbo, the Plane of Chaos|Limbo]]**, is no less dangerous than the Great Below. They adapt quickly. The main githzerai force is the **[[Cenobites of Zerthimon]]**, "enlightened" monks who use their psionic powers to hunt and destroy mind flayers wherever they take root. They seek the colony—and its heart.

## **Outposts in the Great Below**

The githzerai establish a string of disciplined waystations in the **[[Underdark, the Great Below|Underdark]]**—**outposts**: places to rest the mind, gather supplies, and reset the focus that drives their pursuit.

These outposts tend to share the same traits:

- **Functional layouts** built for surveillance, defense, and rapid sorties. Comfort is secondary to readiness.

- **Strategic positioning and alien architecture**: Outposts occupy tunnel junctions and choke-routes, chosen to watch, intercept, and withdraw with precision. Their structures are unmistakably foreign—hard angles, exotic materials, and seamless joins that make the cavern feel repurposed rather than inhabited.

- **Psionic and warded defenses**: As a race with innate psionic ability, their watchposts are protected by illusions, wards, and psionic traps—screens and failsafes designed to mislead, delay, or break intruders before a siege can take shape.

- **Teleportation mechanisms**: Psionically engineered transit-anchors—keyed, repeatable, and tightly controlled—used for reinforcement, evacuation, and swift repositioning.

Reinforcements from Limbo arrive over the centuries, bringing specialists beyond the cenobite core—trackers, translators, survivalists, lore-keepers, and scouts trained to read what the mind flayers leave behind: absence, silence, and wrongness.

## **The Hunt That Defines the Age**

Most of this era is not open war. It is **pursuit**.

The githzerai hunt by method and patience: isolating thrall networks, tracing vanished patrols, watching for repeating routes, and striking only when the odds favor certainty. They learn quickly that the Underdark rewards the loud with death and the careless with manipulation. Their raids are therefore surgical—aimed at freeing captives, breaking key nodes of control, and erasing evidence that could be turned against them.

Mind flayers answer in kind: false trails, baited survivors, and layered misdirection. The contest becomes one of endurance. Both sides are willing to spend decades for a single decisive gain.

By the later centuries of the era, the githzerai know they are no longer chasing scattered survivors. They are containing something that has survived long enough to restabilize.

## **Late Surface Contact (c. –3617 to –3500)**

Only in the last century do a handful of githzerai parties begin to surface in small numbers—not to settle, but to secure information and deny the mind flayers easy access to fresh prey.

These contacts are rare, cautious, and usually brief. They are most likely to occur with groups already accustomed to boundaries, secrecy, and long vigilance:

- dwarven [[Deepwardens]] and sanctioned delvers operating under crown oversight

- arcane observers who recognize planar intrusion as a category of threat

- [[Druid|wardens]] and sentinels who treat "disappearances" as something to be traced, not mourned

Even then, the githzerai rarely explain themselves in full. Their doctrine prizes focus: names and motives are shared only when they serve the hunt.

## **What This Changes**

With the **[[Cenobites of Zerthimon]]** entrenched below, the Underdark gains a second unseen power—one that opposes the **[[Illithid (faction)|illithids]]** with relentless precision.

- The mind flayer colony is denied the freedom to expand openly.

- Thrall networks are disrupted often enough to slow consolidation.

- A quiet counter-presence is established: disciplined, watchful, and unwilling to let the mind flayers simply “wait out” the world.

By the end of the era, the pursuit has become doctrine: the outposts remain, the hunt continues, and the deep war does not end—only deepens.

## **From Deep Hunters to Dragonforged Blood**

While the Underdark hosts wars fought in silence and psionic shadow, the surface sees other powers shape new mortal lineages—recorded in **[[1.4.4 — Birth of the Dragonforged People (c. –4057)|Birth of the Dragonforged People]]**.
