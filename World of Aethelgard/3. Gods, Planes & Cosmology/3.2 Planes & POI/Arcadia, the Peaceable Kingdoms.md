# **_The Plane of Perfect Order, Harmonious Community, and Lawful Good Ideals_** 
 
Arcadia is the plane where law and good blend into flawless harmony, a realm where every orchard, field, and fortress seems placed by divine geometry. It is a paradise of structured beauty — not rigid, but purposeful — where nature itself follows gentle order and the land prospers without strife. Here, justice is calm, community is instinctive, and harmony is woven into the landscape. Arcadia embodies the ideal that good flourishes best when shaped with wisdom and structure.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

Arcadia consists of **two vast layers**, each reflecting a different facet of ordered goodness:

1. **Abellio — the first layer** — golden plains partitioned by gleaming canals, radiant citadels of celestial wardens, and wide, shimmering roads aligned with the heavens. Here, order becomes devotion — communities organize themselves in circles, squares, and spirals that echo the celestial laws that govern the plane.

2. **Buxenus — the second layer** — is a land of rolling metallic forests, immaculate fields, silver streams, and geometric orchards. Every grove has perfect spacing; every tree bears fruit with subtle magical properties; every hill rises at a gentle, measured grade. The land radiates safety and serenity — the sense that everything is exactly where it ought to be.

Long ago, a third layer — **Nemausus** — existed here. But as Arcadia drifted closer to absolute law, Nemausus slid into **[[Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana|Mechanus]]**, becoming part of the great machine of pure order. Its absence is a quiet reminder: harmony must be balanced, or law will overtake good.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Arcadia’s denizens live in cooperative perfection.

The plane is populated by:

- **[[Celestial|Archons]] and [[Celestial]] guardians** who maintain harmony through peaceful vigilance

- **The spirit legions** — petitioners formed from the souls of disciplined, honorable mortals, bound in gleaming ranks of ordered unity

- **Metal-hued woodland animals** whose eyes shine like polished silver and who can see through any illusion

- **Communities of harmonious mortals** who lived lives of steadfast duty and communal virtue

Every being in Arcadia shares a quiet, instinctive sense of belonging. Disputes are rare; collaboration is the default. Even the orchards and forests seem to _cooperate_, growing in perfect geometric arrays as though nature itself embraces order.

The magical fruit of Arcadia — shimmering with metallic sheen — grants boons akin to potions when eaten fresh, but spoils after a brief time, reinforcing the plane’s ethos of **moderation, stewardship, and shared prosperity**.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

Arcadia exerts subtle but profound metaphysical influence:

- **[[Lawful Good]]** — Arcadia balances harmony with order, rewarding honesty, discipline, and communal duty. Acts of deceit or selfish cruelty feel physically heavy here, while cooperation and integrity resonate with the plane’s perfect symmetry. It is goodness expressed through structure.

- **Aura of Civic Harmony —** Travelers feel a gentle urge toward cooperation, honesty, and community-minded thinking.

- **Illusion Transparency —** All animals of Arcadia instinctively see through falsehoods; illusions weaken in their presence.

- **Geometric Growth —** Natural features — forests, orchards, rivers — align into near-perfect symmetry without losing their living essence.

The plane is not oppressive — its order is benevolent, not authoritarian — but evil beings find its harmony deeply uncomfortable, and chaotic creatures feel subtly constrained.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Arcadia represents the ideal that **good thrives when supported by order**. It is the bridge between the strict light of Mount Celestia and the compassionate freedom of the more chaotic Upper Planes. Scholars of the Outer Planes often compare Arcadia to a “garden of virtues” — cultivated, luminous, peaceful.

Mortals who dream of Arcadia often see:

- Metallic trees rustling in warm, measured breezes

- Fruit orchards aligned like constellations
 
- Ranks of shining warriors marching in perfect harmony
 
- Fields bathed in golden, balanced light 

Arcadia is not a plane of perfection but of **aspirational balance**: the belief that community, order, and goodness together create a world where all may prosper.
