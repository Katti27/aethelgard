# **_The Sixfold Prison of Betrayal, Exile, and Corrosive Despair_**

Carceri is the plane where broken oaths, failed rebellions, and discarded servants are cast aside and left to sink. A chain of hostile world-spheres suspended in a stagnant red void, it is a realm where nothing is destroyed quickly—everything is worn down. Hope, loyalty, and purpose are stripped away layer by layer until only bitterness, paranoia, and stubborn resentment remain. Carceri embodies the conviction that once you have been thrown away, there is no true way back.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

Carceri consists of **six immense, nested spheres**, each with land and sea curving along its inner surface beneath a dull crimson sky. Paths, rivers, and chasms almost always lead downward, deeper into the plane.

1. **Orthrys — The Marsh of False Oaths** — A world of reeking swamps, half-sunken fortresses, and toppled idols. Rotting banners and rusted armor mark the sites of forgotten campaigns. Exiled armies and outlawed cults linger here, still clinging to lost causes that no one beyond Carceri remembers.

2. **Cathrys — The Flensing Wilderness** — Tangled, toxic jungles, thorn-forests that tear flesh and gear, and acidic bogs that devour shelter. Hunters and assassins who betrayed their own kin stalk one another here, trapped in endless cycles of ambush and reprisal.

3. **Minethys — The Desert of Shattered Promises** — A landscape of razor sand, jagged canyons, and constant scouring storms. Towers and cities are buried, eroded, or broken apart. Grand designs cannot endure; only grim survival and the knowledge that every refuge is temporary.

4. **Colothys — The Cliffs of Desperate Clinging** — Endless knife-edged mountains and abyssal ravines threaded by rope-bridges and precarious ledges. Settlements cling to cliff faces, always one misstep away from annihilation. Here, **[[Malar, the Beastlord|Malar]]** keeps hidden hunting grounds where prey are driven toward the edge—forced to choose between being torn down or cast off.

5. **Porphatys — The Drowned Twilight** — An inky, freezing ocean dotted with small, treacherous islands. The water freezes and thaws without pattern, trapping ships in black ice or dragging them beneath. Survivors from failed mutinies, shattered fleets, and drowned revolts huddle on the islands, plotting escapes that never come.
 
6. **Agathys — The Silent Core** — The deepest sphere: a solid mass of translucent, blood-red ice. Shadowy shapes—fiends, mortals, and lesser powers—lie entombed within, fully aware yet unable to move or speak. Agathys is the end of all motion and all appeals: the verdict made permanent.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Carceri is crowded with the discarded, but the plane itself belongs above all to the **demodands**.

- **Demodands (Gehreleths)** — A unique race of corpse-like fiends native to Carceri. They see themselves as wardens and tormentors, not mere soldiers. Three great castes rule the orbs:
    - **Shators**, the hulking, shaggy “nobility,” hold dominion over vast regions and conduct the plane’s cruel politics.
    - **Kelubar**, slick and reeking, oversee torture, surveillance, and the management of prisoners.
    - **Farastu**, tar-coated and grasping, serve as hunters, enforcers, and shock troops.  
      
    Demodands delight in intricate punishments and long, festering grudges. Even powerful demons and daemons tread carefully in their domains.

- **Petitioners of Betrayal** — Souls whose defining acts were treachery, desertion, or deliberate sabotage of their own cause. They retain clear memory and obsess over their failures, replaying old choices or spinning new schemes that always collapse. Their camps, “kingdoms,” and barricaded enclaves form and fracture in endless cycles of mistrust.

- **Nightmares and Other Monsters** — Steeds and horrors that thrive on fear and misery roam the Depths: nightmare mounts, great predatory birds, shadow-drenched spirits, and strange lesser fiends drawn to the plane’s hunger for suffering. They serve as mounts, guardians, or roaming hazards, loosely controlled by demodands or left to hunt on their own.

- **Foreign Fiends and Exiles** — [[Devil|Devils]], [[Demon|demons]], and [[Daemon|yugoloths]] appear here mostly as **prisoners, outcasts, or temporary raiders**, not as native powers. A few powerful outsiders carve out small redoubts or cut deals with demodand lords, but most lower-planar visitors treat Carceri as hostile ground where one misstep can make them part of the inventory.

Culture in Carceri revolves around **control, humiliation, and slow decay**. Demodands view everything—petitioners, monsters, outsider fiends—as resources to be used and broken. Alliances are tools, not bonds, and every arrangement is expected to end in someone’s ruin.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

Carceri’s metaphysical laws are built around resentment, abandonment, and narrowing choices.

- **[[Neutral Evil]] (with [[Chaotic Evil]] influences)** — The plane blends cruel codes, selfish impulse, and spiteful malice. Contracts are written to fail, rebellions are doomed from within, and even acts of mercy are twisted into leverage. Good-aligned visitors feel undermined and exhausted; chaotic ones find their defiance reduced to empty gestures.

- **Entrapping Passage —** Exiting Carceri is difficult even with powerful planar magic. [[Teleport]] and [[Plane Shift]] often falter unless the traveler sacrifices something meaningful: abandoning an ally, relinquishing a treasured item, or accepting a binding curse. The simplest routes out nearly always require an act that echoes the plane’s themes of betrayal.

- **Emotional Corrosion —** The longer mortals remain, the more their memories tilt toward suspicion and pessimism. Old friendships look naïve; victories seem hollow. Attempts to act with faith, trust, or optimism feel subtly strained, as if pushing against the grain of the plane itself.
 
- **Hostile Environments —** Each layer assaults the body and erodes security. Armor dissolves in Cathrys, fortifications crumble in Minethys, bridges snap in Colothys, and boats sink or freeze in Porphatys. Safe havens decay quickly, pushing inhabitants toward desperate choices and grim bargains.

- **Clarity Without Comfort —** Illusions and comforting lies weaken here. Divinations favor brutally honest answers, revealing how dire a situation truly is. Carceri offers stark insight paired with the sense that all apparent solutions demand an unacceptable cost.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Carceri is the multiverse’s **great dumping ground**—the place where powers send problems they refuse to face.

Gods, archfiends, and planar authorities use it to:

- Imprison failed champions and treacherous lieutenants

- Bury dangerous conspirators and demagogues who no longer serve any side

- Lock away artifacts tied to shameful bargains or abandoned wars

- Absorb uprisings, cults, and crusades that collapsed under internal betrayal

Unlike the Nine Hells or the Abyss, Carceri rarely sustains lasting empires. Domains arise, harden under paranoia, and eventually fracture from within. The only constant is failure: every banner and ideology here ultimately succumbs to the same pattern of mistrust.

Mortals who dream of Carceri often see:

- Swamps of rusted standards beneath a red, stormless sky

- Endless cliff paths where companions tear at one another’s grip to claim the last handhold

- Black seas swallowing nameless ships

- Silent figures frozen in crimson ice, watching but unable to speak

In every age, Carceri stands as the place where faith, loyalty, and purpose are not shattered in fury, but simply **thrown away and left to sink**.
