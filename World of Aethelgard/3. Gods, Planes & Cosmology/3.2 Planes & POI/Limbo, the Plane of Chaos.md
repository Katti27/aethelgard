# **_The Shifting Expanse of Unmaking, Will, and Infinite Possibility_**

Limbo is the Outer Plane of absolute chaos — a limitless, roiling storm of raw creation and dissolution where the elements surge without pattern, form, or mercy. Mountains erupt and dissolve in seconds; oceans boil into nothingness; air becomes fire becomes gemstone becomes void. Nothing in Limbo persists unless held there by strength of will or powerful magic. It is a plane where reality itself is optional and consciousness is the only anchor against oblivion.

Though terrifying to many, Limbo also represents the ultimate freedom: every possibility exists here, waiting to be shaped.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

Limbo has no stable geography. Instead, it is an ever-changing tempest of the four classical elements:

- **Oceans that form and evaporate instantly**

- **Islands of stone drifting through hurricanes of lightning**
  
- **Rivers of magma that turn to flowers mid-fall**

- **Air pockets collapsing into crushing stone cubes**  

Amid this chaos, pockets of stability exist where the plane has been forcibly shaped:

- **Githzerai Strongholds**, walled citadels stabilized by monastic psychic discipline.

- **Floating Battlefields**, where warriors of [[Tempus, Lord of Battles|Tempus]] forge arenas in which their endless conflicts can take form.
  
- **Abyssal Rifts**, where the plane erodes into Abyssal matter — dangerous but potent.

These stabilized regions are tiny compared to the infinite chaos beyond their borders. The moment an inhabitant ceases to enforce structure, reality dissolves again.

**Will is the architecture of Limbo** — A skilled traveler can carve tunnels through storms, build islands in churning seas, or sculpt air into habitable spheres — but only through concentration. The second that concentration wavers, Limbo reclaims its due.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Limbo’s true natives are the **[[Slaad]]**, embodiments of Chaos — grotesque, shifting amphibious monstrosities who act without purpose or morality, driven only by appetite, instinct, and the inscrutable evolution of their species. Red, blue, green, gray, and the rare death [[Slaad|slaadi]] roam the plane in unpredictable migrations.

Opposing them philosophically (and violently) are the **[[Gith|githzerai]]**, ascetic psionic warriors who carve sanctuaries out of Limbo’s madness through incredible discipline. Their monasteries — drifting, cubic, or sculpted like massive stone temples — are marvels of psychic engineering.

Other inhabitants include:

- **[[Tempus, Lord of Battles|Tempus’s]] eternal armies**, dueling endlessly on forged battlefields that drift like islands of violence.

- **Chaos cults**, mortals who believe Limbo’s infinite potential reveals truths hidden in fixed reality.

- **Planar scholars and geomancers**, who study the fundamental instability of Limbo to understand the fabric of magic itself.


Travelers without psychic training or strong magical protections often find Limbo disorienting, dangerous, or outright lethal — not because it hunts them, but because the landscape does not care whether they survive.

## **Divine Realms & Powers**

Two major powers of Aethelgard's pantheon claim refuge within Limbo’s chaos:

1. **[[Tempus, Lord of Battles|Tempus]] — Warrior’s Rest** — a shifting arena-world stabilized only by the eternal will of the god of battle. Within Warrior’s Rest, combatants fight, die, rise again, and fight anew — a crucible of endless warfare.  Here:
	- Courage is the only currency.
    - Regeneration is granted to the bold.
    - Cowardice alone earns true death.
	
	Warrior’s Rest floats through Limbo like a drifting continent of glorified conflict.

2. **[[Leira, Lady of Deception|Leira]] — The Courts of Illusion** —  is a floating palace of ever-changing geometry — a sanctuary where reality loosens and perception becomes sovereign. In this realm:
	- Illusions gain the weight of truth.
    - Lies can become temporarily real.
    - The boundary between thought and world dissolves.
    
    [[Leira, Lady of Deception|Leira]] thrives here because Limbo obeys no law but imagination.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

Limbo alters every being that enters:

- **Chaotic Neutral** — Limbo embodies pure, undirected possibility: a plane where nothing remains stable unless shaped by will. Creatures here feel their thoughts and emotions bleed into the shifting landscape, encouraging spontaneity, instinct, and raw personal expression. Order, structure, and restraint erode quickly, often leaving travelers unmoored unless mentally disciplined.

- **Chaos Morphic Reality** — The environment constantly shifts unless stabilized by:
	- **Willpower** 
	- **Psionics**
	- **Spells of shaping or warding**
	- **Native planar biology**

- **Wild Magic Flux** — All magic is volatile:
	- Spells may surge, mutate, or unravel.
	- Conjuration and transmutation behave unpredictably.
	- Illusions are amplified.

- **Mental Resonance** — Travelers experience intensified emotions, creativity, or mania. Chaotic beings feel empowered; lawful beings often experience existential discomfort or even nausea.

- **Will-Shaping** — Skilled beings can:
	- Carve air into stone
	- Still a storm for a few breaths
	- Build temporary structures
	- Sculpt creatures or tools from chaos-stuff

This is the art of _chaos shaping_ — the signature discipline of the githzerai.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Limbo is the purest expression of possibility. It is:

- A proving ground for will and identity

- A crucible of transformation
  
- A source of raw planar material used by high mages, psions, and artificers

- A domain feared by all orderly civilizations
 
- The birthplace of beings shaped entirely by chaos

In cosmic philosophy, Limbo stands as the opposite of Mechanus: where one embodies perfect order, the other embodies perfect disorder. Both are fundamental to the balance of creation.

Travelers who dream of Limbo often see:

- A sky of shifting colours with no horizon

- Land dissolving beneath their feet
  
- Shapes forming from swirling clouds as if answering their thoughts

- A flash of brilliance — then nothing 

Limbo is not evil, nor is it cruel. It simply _is_ — wild, limitless, and utterly indifferent to the stability that mortals crave.
