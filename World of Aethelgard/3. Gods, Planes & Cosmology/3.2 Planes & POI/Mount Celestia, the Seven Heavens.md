# **_The Ever-Ascending Mountain of Purity, Judgment, and Radiant Order_**

Mount Celestia, also called the Seven Heavens, is the supreme plane of **[[Lawful Good]]**, rising as a single infinite mountain whose seven layers ascend in perfect spiritual progression. Each layer represents a step toward ultimate virtue and enlightenment. The plane is suffused with radiant light, crystalline clarity, and an overwhelming sense of purpose — not merely a place of reward, but a realm of striving, growth, and holy perfection.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

Unlike the fragmented layers of many Outer Planes, Celestia exists as **one continuous, colossal mountain**, each level higher and more exalted than the last. The entire plane is surrounded by an endless **silver sea** whose shores touch the base layer of Lunia. High above, a distant sun casts unbroken light that cleanses illusions, falsehoods, and moral weakness.

The Seven Heavens are:

1. **Lunia — The Silver Heaven**: Waves of holy water lap against shining beaches of glowing silver sand. This is the first step for all souls entering the plane.

2. **Mercuria — The Golden Heaven**: A realm of heroic valor, golden plains, and Bahamut’s radiant palace.

3. **Venya — The Pearly Heaven**: Pastoral slopes, peaceful orchards, and gentle breezes of renewal.

4. **Solania — The Crystal Heaven**: Cloud-wrapped peaks, glittering mountains, and Moradin’s domain of Erackinor.

5. **Mertion — The Platinum Heaven**: Plains of diamond dust and sanctuaries of healing and atonement.

6. **Jovar — The Glittering Heaven**: Sapphire skies above vault-cities of pristine crystal, home to the greatest celestial hosts.

7. **Chronias — The Illuminated Heaven**: A place of pure enlightenment from which no soul returns, the final union with perfect good. 

Each layer is both physical and moral — ascending requires not only movement but growth.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Mount Celestia is home to the greatest hosts of celestial beings: **[[Celestial|Archons]]**, **angels**, **aasimon** and the exalted souls of mortals who embodied law, justice, or noble sacrifice. Petitioners here take on glimmering forms shaped from radiant substance, spending their afterlives in service, contemplation, or purification.

Communities across Celestia are ordered, reverent, and benevolent — but never stagnant. Even the humblest petitioner is encouraged to strive upward, to repent flaws, and to embody a purer form of virtue. Celestia teaches that good is not a state but a journey.

Several of the **deities of Aethelgard** make their home here:

- **[[Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon]]**, keeps court in a gleaming citadel on Mercuria, guiding dragonkind toward righteousness.

- **[[Tyr, the Even-Handed]]**, sits in judgment at his realm on Lunia, where no lie can be spoken.

- **[[Moradin, the All-Hammer]], reigns in Solania within Erackinor, a mountain-fortress of glittering stone.

Their realms reflect their nature: justice sharpened to truth, honor unblemished, craft perfected through eternity.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

**Mount Celestia embodies the metaphysics of lawful good**, and exerts moral force throughout its expanse:

- **[[Lawful Good]]** — Celestia exerts a gentle but firm moral gravity, guiding all who walk it toward virtue, truth, and righteous discipline. Dishonesty, cruelty, and moral weakness are revealed like stains under bright light, while courage and integrity resonate with the mountain’s ascent. It is goodness as a journey upward.

- **Purifying Light —** Lies, illusion magic, and inherently deceptive effects weaken or fail entirely on higher layers.

- **Moral Resonance —** Travelers experience gentle pressure toward honesty, honor, and self-discipline.

- **Ascent Through Worthiness —** Physical travel between Heavens is possible but rarely successful without spiritual readiness; [[Celestial]] guardians assess each traveler’s fitness to ascend.

- **Sanctified Waters —** The ocean of Lunia is holy — drinking or bathing in it cleanses curses, poisons, and spiritual corruption.

Because of this, evil beings are repelled and chaotic ones often feel uncomfortable or exposed. But Celestia does not punish — it teaches.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Mount Celestia is the greatest bastion of **justice, honor, and lawful good** in existence. It stands astride the boundaries between the [[1.1.2 — Birth of the Planes|Upper Planes]] as the ultimate exemplar of discipline and righteousness. Souls who seek harmony, order, redemption, or the perfection of virtue look to Celestia as the ideal.

Mortals who dream of Celestia often see:

- A shining stairway rising into the clouds

- A distant radiant peak they cannot reach

- A silver sea whose waves whisper judgment and forgiveness

In every age of Aethelgard, Celestia has stood as a fixed point — a cosmic lighthouse guiding both gods and mortals toward a higher purpose.
