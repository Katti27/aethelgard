# **_The Eternal Engine of Absolute Law, Precision, and Perfect Order_**

Mechanus is the Outer Plane where law exists at its most absolute and unyielding. It is a realm of endless interlocking gears, rotating at colossal scales across an infinite void — each gear a world-sized disc of metallic landscape, each rotation part of a cosmic mathematics that never errs. Here, everything follows perfect patterns. Chance does not exist. Every sound is rhythmic. Every movement is measured. Every action has a place in the unbroken logic of the Great Machine.

Mechanus is not merely a plane — it is an idea made manifest: **Order without compromise. Structure without deviation. Logic without mercy.**

## **Geography & Cosmology**

Mechanus is composed of infinite, perfectly shaped gears suspended in a void of silver-gray stillness. These gears range from the size of continents to those larger than worlds, rotating in mathematically immaculate synchronization. Their teeth interlock with neighboring gears but never clash — every motion predetermined by the infallible calculus of the plane.

Each gear’s surface is a metal world:

- **Vast clock-cities** with streets laid in precise fractal grids

- **Perfectly geometric mountains** rising in smooth, impossible angles

- **Rivers of liquid quicksilver** flowing in exact, unchanging currents

- **Forests of metallic trees**, each branch split at uniformly measured intervals

- **Labor-forges** where constructs and axiomatic life forms refine themselves in eternal cycles

Gravity is always perpendicular to the gear on which one stands, causing travelers moving between them to experience abrupt shifts in orientation when stepping from one disc to another.

Time flows with absolute regularity: no spell can hasten or slow it here. Even the ticking of the plane itself is measurable — a cosmic heartbeat of law.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Mechanus is inhabited by creatures of pure order and logic, each fulfilling roles within the endless operation of the Great Machine:

- **Modrons** — The dominant species of Mechanus, created as extensions of the plane’s will. Ranging from small, geometric monodrones to the near-divine hierarchs, modrons embody perfect obedience. They maintain gears, record events, adjust cosmic ratios, and ensure order radiates outward from Mechanus into the multiverse.

- **Inevitables** — Construct-like enforcers built to correct violations of fundamental universal laws — enforcing contracts, punishing oath-breakers, hunting those who cheat death or fate, and correcting planar anomalies.

- **Formians** (in some regions) — Hive-minded warrior-civilizations that structure their societies in flawless hierarchical patterns, often claiming territories along the edges of minor gears.

- **Clockwork Petitioners** — Souls aligned with pure law, stripped of individuality and reshaped into metallic forms. They labor joyfully, believing that service to perfect order is the highest enlightenment.

Mechanus does not foster creativity, emotion, or spontaneity — but it is not malevolent. It is the neutral embodiment of order itself: **unbending, predictable, serene, and terrifying**.

Servants of [[Tyr, the Even-Handed|Tyr]], [[Lathander, the Morninglord|Lathander]], [[Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon|Bahamut]], and [[Moradin, the All-Hammer|Moradin]] sometimes travel to Mechanus when investigating cosmic legalities, divine contracts, or [[Celestial]] record-keeping.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

Mechanus exerts strong lawful influence over all who enter:

- **[[Lawful Neutral]] —** Mechanus is absolute, perfect order where every action has purpose and every motion follows law. Those who thrive on structure feel clarified and empowered, while spontaneity, emotion-driven choices, or moral ambiguity are steadily suppressed. The plane demands precision.

- **Ordered Thought —** Chaotic beings suffer discomfort or headaches; their minds resist the plane’s pressure toward structure.
 
- **Suppression of Randomness —** Random effects (wild magic, confusion, etc.) are dampened or cease entirely.

- **Perfect Geometry —** Illusions and shapeshifting become harder to maintain; the plane rejects inconsistent forms.
 
- **Predictable Time —** Time magic falters; haste, slow, or time-stop behave strangely or fail. 

Spells involving law or order are strengthened. Spells involving chaos are weakened, unstable, or outright nullified.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Mechanus is the anchor of absolute law across existence. It is the cosmic metronome against which all time is measured, the mathematical root of all planar geometry, and the silent arbiter of divine and infernal contracts.

Across the multiverse:

- [[Devil|Devils]] appeal to Mechanus to solidify infernal bargains.

- [[Celestial|Celestials]] seek its records to confirm ancient covenants.
 
- The most disciplined mortal scholar-orders send delegations to learn the principles shaping reality.

- Rogue constructs flee here seeking purpose.
  
- And sometimes, the gears tremble — signaling a cosmic event that warps order throughout the planes.


Mortals who dream of Mechanus often see:

- A metallic horizon turning like a great clock
  
- Perfect rows of mechanical trees swaying in unison

- A sky filled with gears of every conceivable size
  
- A voice like a ticking heartbeat whispering equations

- Or the sense that destiny, for once, is measurable
  

Mechanus does not judge or punish—it simply **is**. In its unbroken order, it reflects the law that underlies all things, whether mortals acknowledge it or not.
