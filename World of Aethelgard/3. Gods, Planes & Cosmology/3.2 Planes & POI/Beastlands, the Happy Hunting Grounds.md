# **_The Eternal Wilderness Where Beasts Rule, Instinct Reigns, and Life Walks in Harmony with Itself_**

The Beastlands are a plane of vibrant wilderness, eternal sun and moonlight, and the pure, instinctive rhythms of nature untainted by civilization. A realm of perfect balance between peace and predation, it celebrates life in its rawest and most truthful form. Forests, rolling savannas, soaring mountains, and endless meadows stretch without boundary, illuminated by either a warm sun or a gentle moon depending on the layer. No cities or roads exist—only the paths beasts carve and the instincts that guide them.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

The Beastlands are divided into three immense layers, each defined by the celestial light that governs it:

1. **Krigala — The Daylit Wilds** — Landscapes bathed in eternal daylight. Golden grasslands and towering forests teem with herbivores, swift predators, and vibrant life. This layer is exuberant, loud, and pulsing with vitality.

2. **Brux — The Twilight Wilds** — An endless sunset paints the sky in blues and amber, where nocturnal creatures stir and diurnal ones settle. Here shadows lengthen and instincts sharpen. It is a realm of transition where both predator and prey sense opportunities.

3. **Karasuthra — The Moonlit Wilds** — Bathed in soft moonlight, this layer is home to creatures of the night. Rivers glow faintly silver, and starlight reflects on the fur and feather of its inhabitants. **[[Stronmaus, the Smiling God|Stronmaus]]** maintains **Stormhold** here—an airy citadel surrounded by great thunderheads.

In all layers, the plane’s ecosystems are impossibly lush, with flora blooming in profusion and fauna in perfect ecological balance. Creatures roam freely across layers through instinctive paths known as animal trails, natural planar conduits used by beasts and petitioners alike.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

The Beastlands are populated primarily by:

* **Animals with heightened awareness**—often fully sapient

* **Beast spirits and [[Celestial]] wildlife** 

* **Petitioners** who take on animalistic traits, losing their humanoid forms as they embrace the plane’s harmony 

* **Guardians, guides, and philosopher-beasts** who protect the natural order

All animals here resemble their Material Plane counterparts, but with striking differences: brilliant coloration, gleaming eyes, an aura of awareness, and senses sharpened beyond mortal understanding. Many possess innate ability to see through illusions or deceit.

Death in the Beastlands is never meaningless. Predation is swift and respectful; prey accept their fate, and predators kill cleanly. Life resumes moments later in a renewed form—every creature participates in the cycle willingly and without resentment. The plane is free of cruelty; survival and instinct are the core laws.

Mortals who live here long enough often begin to adopt animal traits—keener senses, paws instead of hands, or fur replacing skin. Those who die here merge completely with the plane, returning as exalted beasts or guardian spirits.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

The Beastlands impose powerful metaphysical laws:

- **[[Chaotic Good]] / [[Neutral Good]]** — Life here is vibrant, instinctual, and unrestrained, celebrating freedom, vitality, and the harmony between predator and prey. The plane rewards authenticity and natural balance while resisting artifice, oppression, or needless violence. Deception feels impossible beneath its honest skies.

* **Harmony With Nature —** Violence born of malice is suppressed; only needful predation or defense functions normally.

* **Truth of Instinct —** Deception magic weakens dramatically. Many inhabitants instantly detect lies or illusions.

* **Animal Empathy Amplified —** Mortals can communicate with beasts effortlessly; beasts understand intentions even from strangers.

* **Transformation Through Spirit —** Prolonged stays gradually bestow animalistic features on mortals—sometimes permanently.

* **The Call of the Wild —** Civilized structures decay rapidly. Tools rust, books mold, and worked stone cracks as nature reclaims everything.

These traits make the Beastlands a realm where the civilized die out and the natural self rises to dominance.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

The Beastlands represent **pure, unfiltered life**—not good or evil, not law or chaos, but the dignity of nature in its primal truth. It is a haven for [[druids]], [[rangers]], [[shapeshifters]], and mortal souls who revere the wild without attempting to tame it.

Travelers come seeking:

* Visions from animal spirits  

* Rare beasts found nowhere else  

* Harmony with nature or release from civilization  

* Lessons in balance, instinct, and survival

In [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]]’s cosmology, **Stronmaus** is the greatest divine presence here, ruling Stormhold amid endless stormcloud hunts. Other nature powers sometimes walk the plane, though few claim dominion—its freedom resists being ruled.

Mortals dream of the Beastlands as:

* A forest that breathes  

* A moonlit river where a wolf drinks beside a deer  

* A sky where storms sing  

* A world where every heartbeat echoes with life

The Beastlands remain a timeless sanctuary—where nature is not backdrop but sovereign, and where every living thing has a place in the eternal song.
