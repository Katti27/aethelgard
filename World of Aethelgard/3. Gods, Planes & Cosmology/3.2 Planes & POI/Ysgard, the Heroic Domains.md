# **_The Eternal Battlefield of Valor, Glory, and Reborn Courage_**

Ysgard is the outer plane where courage is tested, battle is celebrated, and life burns with fierce intensity. A realm of floating earthburgs, titanic mountains, roaring rivers, and endless fields, Ysgard embodies the spirit of heroic struggle. Here, death is but an interlude, and valor is the coin of eternity. It is a plane where mortals and gods alike seek glory not for dominion, but for the joy of challenge and the forging of identity through conflict.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

Ysgard consists of massive, continent-sized “earthburgs” — colossal slabs of land drifting through a starless void, each a self-contained world of mountains, forests, and battlefields. These earthburgs crash, collide, and shear past one another in slow titanic motion, sending rivers cascading into the void only to reform again atop distant slabs.

Three primary layers define the plane:

1. **Ysgard Proper** — Snow-capped peaks, deep fjords, fiery volcanic fields, and endless mead-halls. The air is sharp and invigorating; storms break overhead with joyous fury. This is the realm of constant heroic contest — friendly or otherwise.

2. **Muspelheim** — A fiery realm of magma seas, basalt crags, and flame-wreathed [[Giant]]. Here the spirit of destructive passion rules, and [[Giant|fire giants]] wage their eternal training wars.

3. **Nidavellir** — The cavern-realm of warmth and craft, home to dwarves and master artisans who seek challenges of creation rather than combat. Though no longer Moradin’s seat (his domain is in [[Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens|Celestia]]), the echoes of ancient dwarven myth still shape this layer.

Each layer of Ysgard is wild, vivid, and alive — a world that reshapes itself to inspire courage.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Ysgard is populated by those who embody bravery, passion, and bold individuality.

* **Petitioners & Spirits of the Brave** — Mortals who valued courage, freedom, or personal glory in life find themselves reborn here as hardy, vibrant spirits. Wounds heal within a day, and those slain in battle rise again at dawn, eager for the next challenge.

* **Einherjar & Warrior Hosts** — Hosts of exalted warriors form companies, clans, and shield-bands dedicated to contest, exploration, and tests of strength. They duel as easily as they feast and honor worthy foes as much as beloved companions.

- **Giants & Outsiders** — Storm giants stride across the earthburgs, their thunderous laughter echoing like avalanches. [[Giant|Frost giants]] test themselves in glacial arenas, while [[Giant|fire giants]] brood in Muspelheim’s infernos. [[Celestial|Celestials]] also walk here — those who embody righteous battle or honorable confrontation.

### **Deities of Note**

Several gods from your pantheon dwell in or draw strength from Ysgard:

- **[[Tyr, the Even-Handed]]** — Though his court resides in [[Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens|Mount Celestia]], one of his original realms remains in Ysgard’s Asgard, where he is honored for courage, sacrifice, and justice in conflict.

- **[[Selûne, the Moonmaiden]]** — Her realm, the **Gates of the Moon**, lies here: a gleaming sanctuary of silver luminescence and shifting pathways. From Argentil, her moonlit palace, she guides the Infinite Staircase.

- **[[Kord, the Stormlord]]** — One of Ysgard’s most iconic deities, Kord revels in storm-wars, contests of strength, and heroic ambition. His challenges echo across entire earthburgs. 

- **[[Annam All-Father]]** — The progenitor of [[Giant|giantkind]] holds court in **Gudheim**, a crystalline fortress in Jotunheim. His judgment shapes the fates of giants across the planes.

- **[[Thrym, Lord of the Frost Giants]]** — Ruling his icy dominion in Ysgard’s glacial regions, Thrym plots—ever seeking the eternal winter he dreams of unleashing.

These realms add layers of culture, conflict, and wonder to Ysgard’s ever-shifting landscape.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

Ysgard’s metaphysics demand vigor, passion, and bravery from all who walk its fields:

- **[[Chaotic Good]] / [[Chaotic Neutral]]** — Ysgard celebrates courage, glory, and the unrestrained spirit, rewarding bold action over quiet contemplation. Passion, strength, and personal honor flourish here, while cowardice or rigid law feel suffocating. It is a plane where life’s worth is measured in daring.

- **Death Is Not the End** — Creatures slain in fair combat return to life with the next dawn — healed, whole, and ready to fight again. Only cowardice or refusal of challenge can lead to true death.

- **Glorious Battle** — Weapons gleam brighter, war-cries carry farther, and acts of courage create ripples across the plane. Magic that enhances martial prowess is strengthened.

- **Living Land** — Earthburgs shift position, collide, and reshape terrain. Even the rivers have a will, sweeping the faint-hearted away while carrying the bold toward new challenges.

- **Storm Breath** — Thunderstorms can manifest sentience, challenging travelers with booming riddles or trials of endurance.

The plane rewards bravery and rejects timidity — a realm where spirit matters more than strength.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Ysgard is the crucible of mythic heroism — the place where legends go to sharpen themselves, where gods test their mettle, and where mortal souls learn the meaning of courage.

Mortals who dream of Ysgard often see:

- A longship cresting a stormy sea

- A mountain cracking open to reveal a roaring hall of warriors

- A silver moonlit gate opening onto endless paths

- A hammer blow shaping a world from fire and frost

To the people of [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]], Ysgard represents the ideal of brave living — a grand, wild glory untouched by tyranny or despair. It is a place of triumph, celebration, and the joy of testing oneself against the cosmos.
