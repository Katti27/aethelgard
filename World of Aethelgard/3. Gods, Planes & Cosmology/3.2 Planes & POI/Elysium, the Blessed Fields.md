# **_The Plane of Peace, Renewal, and Unshakable Serenity_**

Elysium, the plane of pure good untainted by law or chaos, is the still heart of the Upper Planes — a realm where peace is tangible, joy is effortless, and hope is as natural as breath. Its four layers flow into one another like a single great river of comfort, each offering a vision of harmony unmarred by strife or sorrow. Travelers describe Elysium not as a place one observes, but as a feeling that wraps around the soul: a gentle certainty that all wounds can heal, all nights can end, and all burdens may finally be set down.

Elysium is the plane toward which exhausted heroes long, where the tired spirits of the just find rest, and where the [[Lathander, the Morninglord|Morninglord's]] renewing light shines brightest.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

Elysium is composed of four layers — peaceful, radiant, and increasingly transcendent:

1. **Amoria — The Golden Meadows** — Rolling fields of flowers, shimmering shallows, and warm lantern-glow evenings. Rivers wander lazily through idyllic countryside, and the golden haze at sunrise seems to hum with distant song. Many travelers first arrive here, swept into a sense of calm that feels instinctively, impossibly right.

2. **Eronia — The Storm-Kissed Rise** — A land of high plateaus, crisp winds, distant thunder, and sudden rains that cleanse the spirit. Dauntless hope lives here — the belief that change is possible and dawn always returns. Eronia hosts two major realms:  
	• **Morninglory**, [[Lathander, the Morninglord|Lathander’s]] radiant citadel, where dawnlight blooms eternally.  
	• **Dweomerheart**, [[Mystra, the Mother of all Magic|Mystra’s]] eternal academy of living magic, whose crystalline libraries float on calm winds.

3. **Belierin — The Still Waters** — A realm of wetlands, mirror-lakes, and deep quiet. Shadows here are soft, not ominous; the plane itself invites reflection and emotional clarity. Petitioner-spirits often walk Belierin’s shores when ready to confront memories they carried in life.

4. **Thalasia — The Ocean of Tranquility** — The deepest, most transcendent layer: a vast, gentle sea dotted with radiant islands. Souls who reach Thalasia feel the last remnants of worldly fear dissolve. It is the purest expression of Elysium’s promise — that peace is not escape, but fulfillment.

Every layer shares the same extraordinary light: warm, forgiving, and utterly without harshness.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Elysium is populated by:

**• The Guardinals** — [[Celestial]] guardians of good born from noble beasts: leonal, cervidal, ursinal, and more. They are the plane’s protectors: kind, patient, and utterly devoted to stopping evil from poisoning peace.

**• Petitioners of Perfect Peace** — mortals whose goodness was rooted in compassion, selflessness, and gentle hope rather than law or passion. Their forms glow faintly, and their emotions radiate through the air like soft music.

**• Divine Retinues of [[Lathander, the Morninglord|Lathander]] and [[Mystra, the Mother of all Magic|Mystra]]** — dawn-saints, spell archivists, radiant messengers, and servants made of woven light or spellscript.

Communities in Elysium are small, intimate, and sincere — villages of open doors, orchards heavy with fruit, and riverbanks lined with lanterns that never extinguish. Even the animals embody peace: luminous fish drift in the rivers, silver-furred deer graze without fear, and flocks of radiant birds move like drifting stardust.

Conflict is absent not because it is forbidden, but because **no one desires it**.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

Elysium exerts powerful metaphysical influences:

- **[[Neutral Good]]** — The plane radiates peace and pure benevolence without judgment, coercion, or hierarchy. Visitors feel their anxieties melt into calm purpose, as though guided by a gentle moral current. Malice or manipulation, however, is quickly subdued by the plane’s quiet, pervasive serenity.

* **Irresistible Calm —** The deeper one travels, the stronger the plane’s serenity becomes. Those who remain too long risk losing all desire to leave — not through magic, but genuine fulfillment.

* **Harmony of the Soul —** Spells tied to healing, restoration, light, and emotional clarity strengthen. Spells of compulsion, fear, and necromancy weaken or simply fail.

* **Waters of Memory —** Rivers in Elysium cleanse mental corruption, nightmare residue, and despair. Drinking from them allows mortals to process grief with supernatural clarity.

* **Resistance to Evil —** Creatures of malice or cruelty suffer spiritual exhaustion merely by existing here.

The plane is neither naive nor unguarded — it is protected by the most steadfast defenders of good in all existence.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Elysium stands as the **archetype of true goodness** — goodness that asks nothing in return, goodness that comforts rather than commands, goodness that heals rather than judges.

To many mortals, visions of the afterlife drift toward images from Elysium:

* A radiant meadow beneath a warm sky  

* A river reflecting dawnlight  

* A quiet shore where burdens finally fall away

Heroes who die with hearts uncorrupted often come here. So too do those who suffered greatly in life and deserve rest without condition.

For Aethelgard’s scholars, Elysium is the lodestar of pure benevolence:  
**[[Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens|Celestia]] demands righteousness. [[Arborea, the Olympian Glades|Arborea]] celebrates passion. Elysium offers peace.**

And in a world shaped by conflict — Great Wars, crusades, divine calamities — the Blessed Fields remain the multiverse’s promise that kindness has a home, unbroken and eternal.
