# **_The Plane of Despair, Draining Shadows, and Hopeless Dread_**

Hades, also called the Gray Waste, is the nadir of the multiverse — the plane where hope withers, passion dissolves, and meaning erodes into cold ash. Neither fiery with malice nor storming with chaos, Hades is a calm, suffocating silence that smothers joy, purpose, and memory. It is the truest embodiment of **[[Neutral Evil]]**, a place where suffering is not inflicted through cruelty or rage, but simply allowed — encouraged — to exist as the natural order.

The Gray Waste is a realm of muted color, endless gloom, and oppressive stillness. Its three layers — **Oinos**, **Niflheim**, and **Pluton** — descend deeper into apathy and spiritual exhaustion. Mortals who linger too long feel their willpower ebb like leaking sand; even fiends tread cautiously here, lest the plane’s draining presence hollow them out.

Hades is the source of despair itself. From its mists drift nightmares, plagues, and melancholy into the other planes. Many of the multiverse’s greatest tragedies trace back to seeds planted in its shadows.

## **Geography & Cosmology**

The Gray Waste consists of **three layers**, each increasingly barren and spiritually corrosive:

1. **Oinos — The Land of Disease and Rot —** A seemingly infinite plain of gray-brown soil, choked trenches, dying forests, and stagnant battlefields. The air is thick with miasma. Pestilence spreads effortlessly; even gods tread lightly here. The **River Styx** cuts through Oinos, its waters carrying forgetfulness and sorrow.

2. **Niflheim — The Endless Gloom —** A forested layer of fog-choked pines, dripping boughs, and snow that never fully settles. Every sound is muffled. Nothing is bright. It is perpetually twilight, the color of a dying memory. **Shar’s domain, the Palace of Loss**, stands here — a fortress of shadow with no visible entrance, where grief is refined into weaponry.

3. **Pluton — The Dust of Forgotten Souls —** The final layer, a vast plain of gray dust where the footprints of the dead linger forever. Trees here bear withered golden leaves said to be the last fragments of lost hopes. It is the most spiritually corrosive place in the multiverse — the birthplace of many apathy-born undead and despair-driven fiends.

Across all layers, colors seem leached, voices fade quickly, and memories slip like water through fingers.

## **Inhabitants & Culture**

Hades devours culture. Nothing thrives here — things only endure.

- **Petitioners —** Souls who arrive in Hades slowly become hollow reflections of their former selves. Over time, they lose all memory, identity, and emotion, becoming little more than wandering shadows.

- **[[Fiend|Fiends]] —** The primary inhabitants are:
	 
	- **Night Hags**, who harvest despair from mortals and ride the dreams of the dying.
	- **[[Daemon|Yugoloths]]**, mercenary fiends whose origin myths link them to the very soil of Oinos.
	- **[[Devil|Lemures]]**, broken fiends formed from tormented souls, constantly reshaping in the gloom.
    
	Many fiends use Hades as neutral ground for war-forging, brokering underworld contracts, or trading in misery.

- **Deific Presence —** From the pantheon of Aethelgard:
	
	- **[[Shar, Mistress of the Night]]**, maintains her secondary realm — the **Palace of Loss** — in Niflheim. Here she hoards grief, sorrow, and unfulfilled longing like gemstones.
    
	- Other lesser entities tied to despair, entropy, or oblivion occasionally manifest here.

Even divine realms feel fragile in Hades; the Waste erodes everything in time.

## **Planar Nature & Traits**

**Hades exerts crushing metaphysical forces that erode emotion, identity, and resolve:**

- **[[Neutral Evil]] —** The plane drains purpose, compassion, and ambition alike. Visitors become apathetic, then despondent, then hollow as the Waste strips away all joy and meaning. Even fiends lose distinction here, their hatred smothered into dull inevitability.

- **The Color Bleed —** All color fades to gray unless actively protected by magic.

- **Emotional Drain —** Prolonged exposure forces saving throws or the gradual loss of morale, hope, and eventually Wisdom itself.

- **Memory Erosion —** Memories become difficult to retain; long-term visitors forget why they came, then who they are.

- **Despair Magnetism —** Creatures with depression, guilt, or regret are spiritually “heavier” here — the plane tugs at their psyche like gravity.

- **Stygian Influence —** The **River Styx** runs strongest in Oinos, its waters enhanced by the Waste. Memory loss from immersion becomes nearly absolute.

- **Ceaseless Decay —** Material goods rust, rot, and unravel more quickly, especially items imbued with joy or sentimental value.

## **Role in the Multiverse**

Hades is the quiet, suffocating center of [[Neutral Evil]] — a plane that corrupts not through violence or temptation, but through **inevitability**. Even the mightiest heroes feel their resolve dim in its mists. Many cosmic disasters begin with despair that was, unknowingly, stirred from the Gray Waste.

Mortals dream of Hades only in nightmares, usually seeing:

- Gray fields where their footsteps sink deeply

- A crow perched silently on a twisted tree
 
- A memory they cannot hold
 
- Snow or ash falling in utter silence 

Hades is not a place of punishment or rage — it is the embodiment of **nothingness triumphing over purpose**. Once the Waste takes hold of a soul, it rarely lets go.
