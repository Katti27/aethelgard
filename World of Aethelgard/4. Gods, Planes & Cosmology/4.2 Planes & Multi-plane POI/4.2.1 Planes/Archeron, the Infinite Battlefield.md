## **_The Iron Plane of Ordered War, Falling Stars, and Unending Clamor_**

Acheron is the plane where conflict never sleeps. Suspended in a void of blackness drift titanic iron cubes and razor-edged shards, forever colliding and grinding against one another. It is the Outer Plane where law and evil meet in their most brutal expression: obedience enforced by warfare, identity forged in battle lines, and eternity measured in campaigns rather than years. Every sound here is clash, impact, marching boots, and the distant roar of armies that never truly die.

### Geography & Cosmology

Acheron consists of **four distinct layers**, each a different face of ruthless, regimented conflict:

1. **Avalas — The Battlefields of Iron** — The uppermost layer is an endless void filled with **continent-sized iron cubes** and monolithic polyhedrons, each bearing fortresses, trenches, foundries, barracks, and banners. Gravity pulls toward the surface of each block, so soldiers can fight on “every side” of a given cube. When blocks drift close or collide, armies launch invasions across the narrow gap or sudden impact zone. The **River Styx** cuts through Avalas, carrying the damned and the desperate between warfronts.

2. **Thuldanin — The War Junkyard** — Below Avalas lies a graveyard of discarded campaigns: smaller fragments of cubes, broken siege engines, shattered constructs, rusted ships, and half-buried weapons. Many relics here still crawl, twitch, or mutter battle-cries from ancient enchantments. Time and magic are unstable; items left too long risk turning to brittle stone or dust. It is a dangerous salvage ground for those seeking lost war machines and forgotten armaments.

3. **Tintibulus — The Geometries of Law** — This layer replaces cubes with perfect polyhedra — octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and stranger shapes, all of metal and stone. Their surfaces are etched with runes, diagrams, and frozen images of past battles. Here war becomes abstraction and doctrine: a place of commanderies, codices, tactical schools, and cold memorials. Voices echo strangely; memories and strategies seem to crystallize in the air itself.

4. **Ocanthus — The Shardstorm** — The lowest, deadliest layer is a screaming gale of razor-thin, obsidian-black iron shards. These blades hurtle through the dark at tremendous speed, capable of slicing spells apart and ships to ribbons. Only the most hardened or desperate entities dwell here, in hidden redoubts built from fused shards or within armored fortresses drifting amid the storm. Even fiends respect Ocanthus — it devours the careless.

Gravity in Acheron is always “down” to the nearest massive object. When cubes collide, their gravitational fields overlap, creating strange zones where “down” shifts abruptly, sending armies careening sideways in the middle of battle.

### Inhabitants & Culture

Acheron is populated by **legions** — mortal petitioners, petitioned souls forged into spirit-soldiers, fiends, and extraplanar hosts conscripted into endless wars. Most residents are unit before individual: they think in terms of ranks, banners, regiments, and campaigns. Honor here comes not from mercy, but from discipline, loyalty, and effectiveness.

Among the most fearsome presences in Acheron are the **[[Orc|orchish]]** gods:   

- **[[Gruumsh, the One-Eye]]**, rules from his realm **Nishrek**, a colossal war-camp spread across colliding iron blocks in Avalas. Here, orcish petitioners fight, die, and rise again, honing themselves in never-ending tribal war. The thunder of war drums and the blare of horns never cease.

- **[[Luthic, the Cave Mother]]**, also holds domain in Acheron, guiding the endurance, cohesion, and survival of orcish clans. Her influence appears in fortified warrens, iron-banded longhouses, and ritual blood-circles where wounds are bound and new warriors are sworn.


Other inhabitants include disciplined devils on campaign, mercenary companies from across the planes, construct armies, and the restless dead who found no peace in calmer afterlives. Many mortal souls who loved structure but lived by the sword end up here: generals, siege engineers, fanatical captains, executioners, and “loyal” tyrants.

Culturally, Acheron values:

- Obedience to command

- Ruthless efficiency

- The erasure of individuality into the unit

- Memory of grudges across centuries

Peace is not simply rare — it is considered suspect.

### Planar Nature & Traits

Acheron enforces a very specific kind of metaphysical order:

- **[[Lawful Evil]] —** The plane subtly rewards hierarchy and punishment. Creatures inclined toward disciplined cruelty or unquestioning obedience find it easier to resist fear, exhaustion, and doubt. The compassionate or free-spirited feel ground down.

- **Eternal Campaign —** On many cubes, death in battle is not final. Spirit-soldiers may rise again at dawn, bound to continue the fight. True annihilation often comes only through cowardice, desertion, or defiance of the war-structure, which the plane itself punishes.

- **Resonant Iron —** The massive cubes and shards **ring when struck**, and some fixed portals between Acheron and other planes are hidden within specific tones. Veterans learn that a block’s “song” hints at where its gateways lead — to [[Mechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana|Mechanus]], the [[Baator, The Nine Hells|Nine Hells]], the [[Outlands, the Concordant Opposition|Outlands]], or elsewhere.

- **Dulled Compassion —** Over time, visitors feel empathy dim and grudges sharpen. Old slights return to mind, and tactical thinking starts to overshadow moral consideration. Commanders who linger too long here frequently return home more ruthless and less human.

### Role in the Multiverse

In the wider cosmology, Acheron is the **armory and drill ground of tyranny** — a crucible for armies that serve lawful evil masters or causes. [[Devil]] legions may pass through on their way to other fronts; orcish warbands train for invasions that reach into worlds like [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]]; mercenary companies bargain here for infernal contracts or divine sponsorship.

For Aethelgard specifically, Acheron looms as:

- The spiritual destination of many orcish war-souls aligned with [[Gruumsh, the One-Eye|Gruumsh]] and [[Luthic, the Cave Mother|Luthic]].

- A recruiting ground for dark powers looking for disciplined killers.

- A model of what the world might become if order is stripped of mercy and war becomes the only true law.

Mortals who dream of Acheron often see:

- Two iron continents colliding in slow motion, cities shattering silently on impact.

- A sky full of falling blades.

- Regiments marching in perfect lines toward a horizon of endless trumpets.

In every age, Acheron stands as a warning: **when structure devours compassion and loyalty serves only conquest, all roads lead to the iron cubes.**
