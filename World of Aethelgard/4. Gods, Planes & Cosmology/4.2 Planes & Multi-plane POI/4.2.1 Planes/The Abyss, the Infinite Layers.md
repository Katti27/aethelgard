## **_The Bottomless Chasm of Unbound Evil and Devouring Chaos_**

The Abyss is the plane where evil sheds every restraint and plunges into pure, ravenous chaos. It is a bottomless well of nightmare worlds stacked atop one another in no coherent order, each layer a separate catastrophe of cruelty, madness, and appetite. No law, pact, or moral principle holds here for long—only raw will and the hunger to dominate or destroy.

The Abyss embodies the idea that if malice is left unchecked, it will not simply conquer—it will eventually devour itself, screaming.

### **Geography & Cosmology**

The Abyss is said to contain **endless layers**, each a world, a prison, or a wound in reality. They are not neatly stacked or ordered: rifts, chasms, and dimensional tears connect them in ways that defy maps or prediction. A traveler might tumble from a sky of burning blood into a trench of living shadows with no warning.

Some widely known layers include:

1. **Pazunia — The Plain of Infinite Portals** — A wasteland of dust, chasms, and titanic sinkholes. Each yawning pit opens into deeper layers of the Abyss. Here demonic hordes gather, warbands clash, and the occasional [[Devil|devil]] or [[Daemon|yugoloth]] army makes incursion for the Blood War.

2. **Thanatos — The Bleak Kingdom of Bones** — Domain of [[Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath|Orcus]], a realm of colossal ossuaries, frozen necropolises, and skies thick with undead. Rivers of corpses grind slowly past ivory citadels, and the air itself tastes of grave-dust and forgotten prayers.

3. **The Endless Maw** — A storm-wracked expanse of flesh-like earth and living canyons whose walls gnash with teeth and tentacles. Whole armies vanish into its gullets. Here, hunger is a landscape and digestion is a weather pattern.    

4. **The Demonweb Pits** — A labyrinth of **webbed caverns, hollowed asteroids, and suspended bridges** turning slowly in a starless void. This is the realm of **[[Lolth, the Dark Mother|Lolth]]**, where spider-web strands span miles, and cities cling to them like cocoons. Gravity shifts along the silk paths; a single misstep can send travelers falling into infinite darkness or sticky fate.

5. **The Torrent Rift** — A vertical ocean-layer where gravity pulls sideways and entire seas plunge eternally down a world-spanning waterfall. Demonic leviathans and storm-witches fight over islands of shattered stone suspended in the roar.

Distances, directions, and even causality can twist within and between these layers. The **River Styx** sometimes cuts through the upper reaches, but its course is treacherous and ever-changing, carrying the damned into wars they never chose.

### **Inhabitants & Culture**

The Abyss seethes with entities that are less a “culture” and more an ever-shifting battlefield of urges weaponized into flesh.

- **Demons** — The primary natives of the Abyss and its defining force. Demons are [[Chaotic Evil]] incarnate: rage, sadism, despair, and hunger made animate. They range from lesser swarms of manes and dretches to towering balors and unique demon lords. Most have no interest in stability; they want blood, terror, and the thrill of breaking things that thought they were safe.

- **Demon Lords** — Unique, godlike demons who rule specific layers as personal hell-kingdoms. Each embodies a particular flavour of ruin—slaughter, undeath, debauchery, corruption, madness, or conquest. Their “domains” are not orderly realms but zones where their obsessions warp everything into a reflection of their will.

- **[[Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath|Orcus]]** — One of the most feared among them. From his throne in Thanatos, he commands endless undead legions, necromantic cults, and lich-servants. His followers seek to replace the natural cycle of life and death with eternal, enslaved unlife, trading their own souls for the promise of undying power.

- **[[Lolth, the Dark Mother|Lolth]]** — The spider-queen of the Demonweb Pits. She rules a tangled realm of webs, chasms, and suspended cities where [[Drow|drow]] petitioners, priestesses, and fiendish spider-broods scheme and betray in her name. Many drow souls gravitate here after death, and her influence spills outward through cults, bargains, and alliances with other demon lords when it serves her designs.

- **Abyssal Beasts and Spawn** — Monstrous creatures born from the plane itself: chimeric horrors, corrupted elementals, carnivorous landscapes, living storms, and oozing masses that barely qualify as individual beings. Many demon lords breed or shape these horrors as weapons.

- **Cultists and Captives** — Mortals, petitioners, and damned souls dragged or drawn here. Some serve demons willingly in the hope of power; others are broken into servitude or toyed with until they die. Entire mortal cults sometimes relocate into a favored layer to live and die at their master’s whim.

- **Rival Fiends** — [[Devil|Devils]], [[Daemon|yugoloths]], and other [[Fiend|fiends]] sometimes invade the Abyss or negotiate temporary alliances. These efforts rarely last; eventually, the Abyss’s chaotic evil essence turns every pact into a bloodbath.

Each layer is a separate catastrophe. Within an individual lord’s realm, there may be armies, courts, and hierarchies—but they are always vulnerable to sudden coups, frenzies, or divine-level temper tantrums. Any order here is temporary scaffolding built around permanent madness.

### **Planar Nature & Traits**

The Abyss twists reality to match its nature:

- **[[Chaotic Evil]]** — Acts of senseless cruelty, betrayal, and unrestrained impulse are strengthened here. Law, discipline, and mercy feel strained and sluggish, as if the plane itself resists them.

- **Corruptive Presence** — Prolonged exposure wears down sanity and morality. Visitors may feel their inhibitions erode, their tempers shorten, and violent impulses grow harder to resist.

- **Morphic Layers** — Many Abyssal layers are **highly mutable**, reshaped by the will of their ruling demon lord or by the plane’s own violent whims—land cracking open, cities melting, skies bleeding.

- **Hostile Environment** — The landscape itself often attacks: poisonous air, flesh-eating rain, gravity that turns sideways mid-step, or storms that scream with trapped souls.

- **Summoning Resonance** — Conjuration spells that call demons are empowered and easier to cast; bindings and wards that attempt to _control_ them are more likely to twist or fail.

- **Fractured Time and Space** — Paths between layers are unreliable. A portal that opens onto Thanatos one crossing might lead to an entirely different horror the next.

### **Role in the Multiverse**

The Abyss is the ultimate expression of **evil without restraint**—a plane where destruction, corruption, and hatred are not means to an end, but the end itself.

- It is the **primary source of [[Demon|demons]]**, demon lords, and many of the worst monstrosities that haunt the lower planes.

- It serves as the **chaotic counterweight to the rigid tyranny of [[Baator, The Nine Hells|Baator]]**, with their eternal struggle manifesting as the **Blood War**.

- Countless **cults, warlocks, and fanatics** across the planes draw power from Abyssal patrons, trading sanity and soul for immediate strength.

- Many **cursed artifacts, corrupted sites, and spreading demonic taints** in mortal worlds trace their origin to some forgotten Abyssal layer.

- For the doomed or the depraved, the Abyss is often the final destination after death, their essence dissolving into the endless, howling swarm of its denizens.

To speak of the Abyss is to speak of a wound in reality that never closes—a plane where every horror is possible, and most of them are already happening.
