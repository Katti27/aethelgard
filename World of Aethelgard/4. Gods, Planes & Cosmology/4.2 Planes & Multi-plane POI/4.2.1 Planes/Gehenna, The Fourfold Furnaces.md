## **_The Burning Slopes of Ruthless Ambition, Greed, and Calculated Malevolence_**

Gehenna is a plane of four vast volcanic mountains suspended in an endless void, each tilted at a murderous angle so steep that nothing ever stands still. Fire, acid, molten rock, and ash spill perpetually down their sides, creating a realm where survival requires calculation, cunning, and the willingness to sacrifice anything — or anyone — to avoid slipping into the abyss. Here, every negotiation is a trap, every alliance a temporary convenience, and every choice a test of ruthless self-interest.

It is a plane built not for comfort, conquest, or order, but for _ambition sharpened into cruelty_.

### **Geography & Cosmology**

Gehenna consists of **four titanic volcanic mountains**, each a floating, slanted world unto itself:

1. **Khalas — The First Furnace** — A blazing hellscape of lavafalls, rivers of molten metal, ash hurricanes, and burning obsidian plains. Mercenary fiends gather here, and the cries of the damned echo through canyons choked with brimstone.

2. **Chamada — The Second Furnace** — A realm of constant eruptions, geysers of acid, and explosive magma domes. The ground buckles underfoot, and landslides of fire regularly scour entire regions clean.

3. **Mungoth — The Third Furnace** — An icy rendition of torment — frozen fumaroles, volcanoes sheathed in rime, and hailstones that burn as they freeze. The smoke here is cold and suffocating, giving the mountain an eerie stillness broken only by cracking glaciers.

4. **Krangath — The Fourth Furnace** — A dead, black volcanic shell where all fire has gone out. This lifeless furnace is ruled by necrotic winds and tomb-cities where the living are unwelcome. It is a graveyard of ambition, and the cold silence here is more frightening than the flames above.

Each mountain floats isolated in the void, illuminated only by the glow of lava or the reflected light of distant infernos. Gravity always pulls _toward the slope_, forcing all creatures to cling, crawl, or slide — there is no level ground in Gehenna.

### **Inhabitants & Culture**

Gehenna is home to creatures who survive through guile, bargaining, and weaponized self-interest:

- **[[Daemon|Yugoloths (Daemons)]] — The Masters of Gehenna** — The true rulers of the plane, yugoloths embody pure mercenary evil. They sell their services to devils, demons, mortals, and anyone else who can pay — in coin, souls, or cosmic secrets. Their strongholds dot the slopes like cancerous citadels of iron, smoke, and wards. The Oinoloth, lord of disease and corruption, rules from the Crawling City — a fortress that slowly crawls along Mungoth’s surface.

- **Petitioners of Greed and Ambition** — Souls who served no cosmic master but themselves often end up here. They cling to cliffsides, scheming endlessly to climb toward power and escape falling into oblivion. Few ever rise far.

- **Fiendish Mercenaries** — Bartering is the true language of Gehenna. [[Fiend|Fiends]] gather in market-ghettos carved into safe ledges, where weapons, curses, contracts, poisons, and secrets are traded like common goods.

- **Divine Presence (Aethelgard Pantheon) —** No major deity from your pantheon claims dominion here, but agents of **[[Bane, the Lord of Darkness|Bane]]**, **[[Myrkul, the Lord of Decay|Myrkul]]**, and **[[Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth|Asmodeus]]** walk its slopes to broker deals, recruit [[Daemon|yugoloth]] legions, or dispose of rivals.

### **Planar Nature & Traits**

Gehenna exerts harsh, perilous metaphysical forces that test resolve, punish hesitation, and enforce ruthless self-preservation:

- Neutral Evil / Lawful Evil — Gehenna embodies merciless self-interest sharpened into order. Here, no act is altruistic, every bargain hides a price, and survival itself demands constant vigilance. Even lawful beings feel their morality eroding into calculation, while chaotic ones find themselves pressed into predatory discipline.

- **Shifting Gravity Toward the Mountain —** Gravity always pulls toward the incline, not downward. Standing upright is impossible; movement is precarious and exhausting.

- **All Things Slide Toward Ruin —** Loose objects — and unwary travelers — inevitably slide downhill. Many die from falls, lava, or the long plunge into the void.

- **Hostile but Negotiable —** Though murderous, Gehenna is not impulsively chaotic. Anyone with something valuable to trade may survive… temporarily.

- **Volcanic Metaphysics —** Fire here burns hotter than any mortal flame. Acid eats through even enchanted materials. Necrotic winds on Krangath drain warmth, willpower, and sometimes life itself.

- **Bargains Carved in Pain —** Contracts made here gain supernatural weight. Breaking a pact in Gehenna often results in immediate retribution by the plane itself.

### **Role in the Multiverse**

Gehenna is the **mercenary heart of the Lower Planes** — the powerbroker between devils, demons, and mortals. It is the cosmic embodiment of ambition without morality, a place where every step forward risks a slide into oblivion.

Its influence leaks into other worlds through:

- Secret pacts brokered by [[Daemon|yugoloths]]
 
- Assassins and mercenaries selling their services across the planes
 
- Artifacts forged in the furnaces of Khalas
 
- Plagues crafted by the Oinoloth to destabilize mortal nations  

In [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]], fiends of Gehenna whisper into the ears of smugglers, warlords, and corrupt nobles — offering power to those willing to pay the cost.

The Fourfold Furnaces stand as a warning:

**In Gehenna, nothing is free. Everything is a bargain. And the slope is always waiting for you to fall.**
