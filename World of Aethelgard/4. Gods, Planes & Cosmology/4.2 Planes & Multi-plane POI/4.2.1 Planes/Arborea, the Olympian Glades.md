## **_The Exultant Realm of Passion, Beauty, and Untamed Freedom_**

Arborea is the quintessential plane of [[Chaotic Good]]—a boundless expanse of wild forests, storm-lashed seas, radiant mountains, and starlit revelry. It is a realm where emotion is elemental, beauty is sacred, and freedom is absolute. Every breeze hums with music, every wave carries memories of ancient joy or sorrow. Arborea is not merely a plane—it is a living symphony of sensation and spirit.

### **Geography & Cosmology**

Arborea is visceral in its beauty and overwhelming in scope. More than any other Upper Plane, it feels _alive_—responding to emotion, memory, and will. Arborea is divided into three vast layers:

1. **Arvandor** — the luminous realm of elven gods and endless wonder — is an eternal wild paradise with colossal trees rising into cloud-wreathed canopies, moonlit glades shimmering with Feywild echoes, and crystal rivers singing as they flow toward shining azure seas. This is the homeland of **[[Corellon, the Creator of the Elves|Corellon]]**, whose realm blends elven beauty, artistry, and magic into a sweeping world of inspiration. Countless elven spirits dwell here, building radiant citadels amid green mountains and crafting art that glows with the Weave itself. Night and day shift gently, often guided by **[[Selûne, the Moonmaiden|Selûne's]]** distant moonlight, and the skies pulse with star-currents not seen on any other plane.

2. **Aquallor** — a plane-wide ocean of tempestuous waves, storm deities, and drowned secrets — is an infinite, storm-thrashed ocean realm. Towering waves, sudden tempests, and thunderous skies define this wild and violent beauty. Floating islands drift like petals on the sea, and colossal sea creatures glide beneath cerulean depths. Tempestuous deities and storm spirits dwell here—some visiting from [[Ysgard, the Heroic Domains|Ysgard]], others born of Arborea’s primal waters.

3. **Mithardir** — a desert of silver sand that holds the ruins of forgotten divine civilizations — once the seat of forgotten godly empires, Mithardir is now a glowing desert of fine silver sands. Its dunes whisper ancient tragedies—ruins swallowed by eternity, citadels half-buried, and memory-laden winds that echo with lost songs. It is said those who wander too far into Mithardir may glimpse the final remnants of divine cultures erased long before mortal history began.

Chaotic good in its purest form, Arborea is the home of unrestrained emotion—fury, joy, passion, creativity—and the belief that freedom elevates the mortal spirit.

### **Inhabitants & Culture**

Arborea’s denizens embody creativity, passion, and emotional truth.

**The Eladrin Courts**—Arborea’s native [[Celestial|Celestials]]—are beings of radiant grace and fierce emotion. They rule from glittering courts built among living forests and starlit mountains. Their hierarchy includes:

* **Ghaele eladrin** — knights of passion and justice

 * **Coure eladrin** — playful spirits of beauty and mischief
 
 * **Tulani eladrin** — luminous nobles of immense magical power
 
Visitors often find the eladrin warm and exuberant—but quick to fury if wronged or confronted with cruelty.

**Petitioners and Spirits** — Souls arriving in Arborea take forms reflecting their passions in life. Many join eternal hunts, feasts, revels, or artistic endeavors. Their afterlives are vibrant, expressive, and deeply communal.

Arborea hosts several of the most influential deities of [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]]:

- **[[Corellon, the Creator of the Elves|Corellon]]**, in Arvandor—god of artistry, beauty, magic, and elvenkind
 
- **[[Tymora, Lady Luck|Tymora]]**, in her realm of **Brightwater**—a radiant coastal paradise of celebration, luck, and fortune
 
- Numerous lesser nature, storm, and fey powers also frequent the layers  

The plane is suffused with their essence—magic that inspires, storms that thrill, and wild lands that encourage freedom and creativity.

### **Planar Nature & Traits**

Arborea exerts powerful metaphysical effects that shape thought, emotion, and environment:

- **[[Chaotic Good]]** — A plane of passion, artistry, and raw emotional truth, where freedom is the highest law. Arborea nurtures expression and impulse, rewarding courage of the heart more than discipline of the mind. Those who cling to rigid order or deception feel the plane push back against them.

- **Emotional Amplification** — Feelings intensify — joy becomes elation, sorrow becomes poetry, anger becomes righteous fury. Magic that manipulates emotion is enhanced.

- **Living Landscape** — The terrain responds subtly to strong emotion:
	- Forests bloom under love or creativity
    - Skies darken and storms gather under grief
    - Seas roar when injustice is spoken aloud

- **Song of Arvandor** — Certain glades and valleys resonate with the Weave itself—spells cast here echo with [[Corellon, the Creator of the Elves|Corellon's]] magic, often taking on artistic or luminous qualities.

### **Role in the Multiverse**

Arborea stands as the heart of passion, beauty, and emotional truth within the Upper Planes. It is:

- A sanctuary for creators, artists, musicians, and dreamers
 
- A bastion of freedom against tyranny and emotional repression

- A birthplace of [[High Elf|elven]] myth, magic, and culture

- A counterpoint to [[Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens|Celestia's]] ordered virtue—here good is wild, joyful, and unrestrained

Mortals who dream of Arborea see:

- Moonlit glades filled with singing wind

- Grand feasts beneath star-fire skies

- Violent, exhilarating storms that cleanse the spirit

- Cities carved from living crystal and luminous trees

To visit Arborea is to feel _alive_ in a way other planes rarely allow—unbound, inspired, and carried on the tides of emotion.
