## **_The Howling Tunnels of Madness, Isolation, and Buried Secrets_**

Pandemonium is an endless hurricane trapped inside solid rock. There is no sky, no ground in any normal sense—only caverns, chasms, and tunnels carved by a wind that never stops screaming. The gale steals warmth from stone and flesh alike, tears words out of mouths, hurls debris like slingstones, and fills the dark with a constant, nerve-shredding roar.

This is where the multiverse discards what it doesn’t want back: cosmic criminals, broken fortresses, buried vaults, and the secrets deemed too dangerous to leave anywhere else.

### **Geography & Cosmology**

Pandemonium is an **infinite mass of stone riddled with caverns**, some narrow enough to crush a creature, others big enough to hold mountains and cities. The wind is everywhere—racing down tunnels, spiraling through chambers, dragging water and debris along in its wake.

**Gravity always pulls away from the local center of a cavern.** You can walk on floor, wall, or ceiling; rivers may cling to one surface, or tear through open space in the center like a sideways waterfall. The **River Styx** begins here, fed by countless icy tributaries flowing along walls and ceilings in defiance of normal physics.

There are **four major layers**:

1. **Pandesmos — The Upper Tunnels**  
    The most “habitable” layer. Vast caverns, twisting passages, and exposed reaches where the wind howls loud enough to deafen in moments. Portals from the Outlands, the Abyss, Limbo and other planes open most often into Pandesmos.
    - The **Madhouse** squats here: a sprawling citadel-city built by planar factions and now run by gangs, merchants, and the deaf or mad. Streets curve with the cavern’s shape; walk long enough and you return to where you started.
    - **Howler’s Crag** rises in a vast chamber—a built spire crowned with a stone portal. A shouted message aimed at a specific person, anywhere in the multiverse, will reach their ears if called from its summit.
    - **The Laughing Mug**, carved near Howler’s Crag, is an infamous taproom that brews its ale from Styx-tainted waters. Drinkers don’t just forget their troubles—they forget themselves.

2. **Cocytus — The Layer of Lamentation**  
    Tunnels narrow, twist, and choke off here. The wind’s tone sharpens into shrill, wailing keens that sound like sobbing, or distant screams. Conversation is possible only by bellowing at arm’s length; beyond ten feet, sound dissolves into noise.
    - Many passages show tool marks, as if this entire layer were **chiseled by unknown hands** in ages past. No one knows by whom, or why.
    - Here stand realms of blood and ambush, including domains of gods of slaughter and bugbear war, surrounded by tunnels hung with severed heads and stained with old battles.

3. **Phlegethon — The Dark and Damp**  
    Gravity settles into a more “normal” downward pull, but the environment becomes worse. Caverns here are humid, ice-cold, and filled with stalactites, stalagmites, and grotesque mineral formations sculpted by aeons of wind and water.
    - Dripping water and howling gusts create the feeling of **constant, freezing rain**.
    - The terrain is treacherous: narrow ledges over black chasms, fungal growths like stone coral, lurking oozes, nightmare crustaceans, and twisted fey that revel in the plane’s cruel mood.
    - The converging flows of the Styx in this layer are home to **howling dragons and Styx dragons**, each jealously claiming stretches of the poisonous river.

4. **Agathion — The Entombed Bubbles**  
    Beyond Phlegethon lies almost nothing but solid rock. **Agathion** consists of isolated pockets: air-filled spheres, airless voids, and chambers packed with howling vortices. Most can only be reached via carefully keyed portals or rare, deep tunnels.
    - These bubbles are favored as **vaults and prisons**: places to hide artifacts, monsters, or unwanted memories where no one sane will ever stumble across them.
    - Opening a gate into a sealed pocket can trigger sudden, violent storms as trapped air erupts into the larger layers.

There is **no natural light** anywhere in Pandemonium. The wind snuffs exposed flames; even magical fire must be shielded to survive. Eternal night, screaming wind, and hostile stone are the plane’s only constants.

### **Inhabitants & Culture**

Pandemonium has no unified society—only enclaves, lairs, and scattered settlements clinging to quieter cracks in the storm.

- **Howlers and native predators** — Spined, four-legged **howlers** stalk tunnels, their cries capable of shredding sanity more surely than flesh. Eyeless bat-things navigate by the wind alone; burrowing horrors chew new passages for the gale to claim. Other creatures—gorbels, demon ropers, and wind-twisted beasts—lurk wherever prey may be hurled past them.

- **Quasits, shadow demons, and lesser fiends** — Pandemonium is thick with **quasits**, **shadow demons**, and other lesser fiends who have learned to thrive in the dark and noise. Some serve greater powers dwelling in more hospitable realms; others are simply fugitives or scavengers, living off whatever the wind brings.

- **The cruel dead and wandering spirits** — The most ruthless souls of brutal warrior cultures sometimes drift here after death, drawn to a place of endless ambush, fear, and cacophony. Wraiths, spectres, and other incorporeal undead haunt wind-carved galleries, particularly near ancient battle sites and divine domains of war and ruin.

- **Planar exiles and blades-for-hire** — Wizards who pushed too far, criminals too dangerous to keep anywhere else, and mercenaries tough enough to survive the journey eke out lives in fortified niches. Many learn or invent sign languages to communicate, since spoken words vanish into the gale.
    - The **Madhouse** in Pandesmos is the closest thing to a hub: a city of the deaf, the deranged, and the desperate, where trade is loud, law is thin, and survival is a daily negotiation.
    - **Windglum**, hidden deeper, is a settlement for those who want to disappear entirely—its residents view strangers with deep suspicion.

- **Strange communities and cults** — Here and there, pockets of altered reality reflect the obsessions of their inhabitants: blood-fed grasslands under storm-lit skies, warped caverns shaped by derro faith into living nightmare dungeons, or harmonic cave complexes where the wind’s song is harnessed for esoteric purposes.

Culture here is intensely local. A single cavern might have:

- a fortress held by a gang of planar thugs,

- a monastery devoted to silence and iron self-control,

- and a hidden inn that serves as a neutral ground for smugglers and fiendish emissaries,


all within a few miles, each barely acknowledging the others.

### **Planar Nature & Traits**

Pandemonium is designed to erode patience, stability, and sense:

- **[[Chaotic Neutral]] / [[Chaotic Evil]]** — The plane favors impulse, volatility, and emotional extremes. Those who value order, quiet, and control feel under constant, invisible pressure.

- **Deafening, freezing winds** — The wind is not just loud—it is **weaponized weather**. Without protection, hearing is overwhelmed within seconds and permanently lost within minutes. The chill saps warmth, leading to hypothermia and exhaustion even in creatures otherwise resistant to cold.
 
- **Sound distortion & mental strain** — The gale carries every shout, scream, and babbled phrase for miles, mixing them into a constant wall of noise. Echoes arrive from the wrong direction, at the wrong time, or in the wrong tone. Over time, the brain starts hearing meaning where there is none—accusations, secrets, or commands buried in the roar.

- **Directional gravity** — Gravity constantly pulls away from the center of each cavern. Those who master this can run along walls, leap between “floors”, or ride the wind through zero-G “sweet spots” in mid-air. Those who misjudge it fall, tumble, and slam into stone in sickening arcs.

- **Hostile environment for fire and speech** — Open flames are unreliable, mundane lanterns are useless, and even magical light must be defended. Spoken communication quickly fails; many long-term inhabitants are deaf, use signs, or rely on telepathy.

- **Erosion of structures and sanity** — Stone, metal, and magic are all worn away over time. Walls soften at the edges; carvings blur; enchantments twist under prolonged assault. Minds fare little better if they stay exposed too long.

### **Role in the Multiverse**

Pandemonium is not a kingdom to conquer or a realm to rule; it is a **howling oubliette**:

- A **dumping ground** for relics, prisoners, memories, and mistakes that cannot simply be destroyed.

- A **testing ground** for those who think they can master chaos, silence their fears, or hear truth inside madness.
 
- A **back alley** of the planes, where deals are struck in stone-sealed rooms while the storm rages outside, and where messages shouted from particular crags can cross the multiverse.
 
- A **warning** that not all horrors are theatrical or glorious—some are just endless noise, biting cold, and the slow realization that you are very small in a very uncaring dark. 

For most travelers, Pandemonium is not a place to visit. It is a place you are thrown into, or a name invoked when someone whispers of fates worse than death: buried in stone, with nothing but the wind and your own thoughts, until you can no longer tell the difference.
