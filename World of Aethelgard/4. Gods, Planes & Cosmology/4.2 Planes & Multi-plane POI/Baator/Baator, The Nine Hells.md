## **_The Infernal Hierarchy of Tyranny, Ambition, and Eternal Damnation_**

Baator — more commonly called the Nine Hells — is the supreme plane of **[[Lawful Evil]]**, a vast, tiered hell-realm of iron discipline, cold logic, and absolute tyranny. Each of its nine descending layers is ruled by an archdevil, but all ultimately bow to **[[Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth]]**, whose citadel Malsheem stands at the bottom of the cosmos like a black crown. Baator is not chaos, not carnage — it is _order weaponized_, cruelty organized, and evil perfected through bureaucracy.

### **Geography & Cosmology**

Baator is structured as a perfectly ordered vertical descent: nine layers, each a world unto itself, each more oppressive than the last. Visitors begin on **Avernus**, a blasted wasteland of blood-soaked battlefields, and if they descend further, they pass into realms of fettered cities, iron palaces, freezing wastes, poisonous seas, and labyrinthine mind-maze prisons, until at last they reach **Nessus**, the deepest pit.

The Nine Layers are:

1. **Avernus — The War-Torn Gate** — A scorched, cratered plain under a burning red sky where devils mass for eternal war, and the River Styx cuts through like a poisoned vein.

2. **Dis — The Iron City** — A planet-sized metropolis of razor-thin streets and labyrinthine districts beneath the watch of Dispater’s colossal Iron Tower.

3. **Minauros — The Sinking City** — A rotting mire of acidic swamps and sinking stone where Mammon hoards wealth in towers that crumble under their own greed.

4. **Phlegethos — The Burning Realm** — Seas of living flame, towers of magma, and infernal academies where Glasya and her court refine cruelty into an art.

5. **Stygia — The Frozen Dusk** — An icy ocean under a black sky, its frozen waves concealing treacherous ruins where Levistus remains entombed in eternal ice.

6. **Malbolge — The Tumbling Pit** — A realm of crushing stone, rolling boulders, and shifting cliffs, ruled by the ever-watchful Hag Countess.

7. **Maladomini — The Ruined Empire** — Endless ruins, failed cities, unfinished palaces, and perpetual construction projects reflecting Baalzebul’s cursed hubris.

8. **Cania — The Ninth Glacier** — A hell of absolute cold, blizzards made of shattered souls, and the furnace-labs where Mephistopheles twists arcana into infernal weapons.

9. **Nessus — The Endless Pit** — A chasm-labyrinth so deep it touches the Astral Sea; here lies Malsheem, the iron palace of **[[Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth|Asmodeus]]**, where infernal law is forged.

The deeper one descends, the more rigid the laws become — until at Nessus, every thought and word feels weighed by invisible decrees.

### **Inhabitants & Culture**

Baator is populated primarily by **[[Devil|Devils]]**: lawful evil fiends bound by hierarchy, contract, and ambition. The greatest hosts are:

- **Nupperibos & Lemures:** The tormented souls of the damned, reshaped into mindless foot soldiers.

- **Bearded Devils & Horned Devils:** Rank-and-file enforcers and battlefield commanders.
  
- **Erinyes:** Fallen celestial warriors turned perfect instruments of lawful cruelty.

- **Pit Fiends:** The generals of Hell, towering engines of infernal war.

- **Archdevils:** Each governs their respective layer, vying for influence while obeying Asmodeus’ supreme authority.

Society in Baator is a rigid caste system defined entirely by power and obedience. Every devil has a superior; every superior has laws; and every law exists to fortify the will of Asmodeus. Contracts — infernal, binding, and impossibly precise — are the currency of Hell.

Across its nine layers, Baator hosts countless damned souls: oathbreakers, tyrants, betrayers, and mortals tricked by infernal bargains. These souls gradually erode into lesser devils, feeding the hierarchy.

Several of the most influential deities of [[World of Aethelgard|Aethelgard]]:

- **[[Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth|Asmodeus]]** rules from **Malsheem** in **Nessus**, the seat of infernal authority and ruler of the Nine Hells. 

- **[[Tiamat, the Dragon Queen]]** dwells in a fortified redoubt on **Avernus**, where she maintains uneasy allegiance to Asmodeus.

### **Planar Nature & Traits**

The plane rewards tyranny, manipulation, and ambition pursued with disciplined precision:

- **Lawful Evil** — The Nine Hells enforce cruelty through perfect order — every rule is a trap, every contract a chain, and every hierarchy a ladder built from suffering. Souls and devils alike are bound by strict, unbreakable law—where obedience is absolute and mercy is an error. 

- **The Rule of Hell:** Devilish law overrides all mortal or magical law; contracts signed here bind the soul across planes.

- **The Voice of [[Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth|Asmodeus]]:** Decrees from Malsheem ripple through all layers, subtly shaping decisions even without direct compulsion.

- **Infernal Elevation:** Souls gradually transform into devils over time, beginning as lemures unless specifically bargained otherwise.

- **Hostile Environment:** Temperatures, hazards, and ambient conditions reflect the nature of each layer — burning heat, acidic swamps, crushing stone, or absolute cold.

- **Diminished Healing:** Natural healing is slowed; magical healing from non-evil sources is weakened, while spells from evil deities are enhanced.

- **Fiendish Gravity:** On many layers, gravity shifts unpredictably or aligns with terrain in disorienting ways (particularly in Malbolge and Nessus).

### **Role in the Multiverse**

Baator is the cosmic embodiment of _law twisted to evil_. It represents tyranny made eternal:

- **The Nine Hells are the greatest military engine in existence**, matched only by the Abyss in ferocity and Mechanus in precision.

- **[[Devil|Devils]] seek souls, influence, and political power** — never wanton destruction.
 
- **Hell’s bureaucracy rivals and often infiltrates mortal legal systems**, offering infernal bargains cloaked in legitimacy.
  
- **The Blood War — the endless conflict between devils and demons — is fought primarily on Avernus**, making it the front line against the [[Abyss, the Infinite Layers|Abyss]].

To mortals of **Aethelgard**, Baator is the ultimate warning: that order without mercy becomes tyranny, and justice without compassion becomes damnation. Dreams of Hell show:

- Iron towers rising over burning plains

- Voices whispering perfect, tempting logic
 
- Contracts written in fire
 
- A distant throne at the bottom of the world 

And always, always, the sense of being judged — not fairly, but completely.
