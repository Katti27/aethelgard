### **Garl Glittergold, the Watchful Protector**
Leader of the gnomish pantheon (the Lords of the Golden Hills), Garl Glittergold is a lawful good greater deity associated with protection, trickery, humor, and gemcutting. Gnomish creation myths hold that he discovered gem-stones hidden in the depths and breathed life into them—linking rock gnomes with diamonds, forest gnomes with emeralds, and deep gnomes with rubies—and then followed the act of creation with a joke that set gnomes on their path of craftiness and mischief.




### **Uthgar, the Battle Father**
An exarch of Tempus, Uthgar is the patron of tribal strength and totem tradition—honoring ancestors, proving worth through sanctioned contests, and binding clans through rites that outlast any single war.

### **Yondalla, the Protector and the Provider**
Head of the halfling pantheon, Yondalla is a lawful good greater deity of protection, fertility, and community. Halfling traditions commonly place her at their beginning as their creator and guardian, with many myths describing her as the one who brought forth the first halflings and watched over them as they found safe lands to settle. She is remembered not only as a mother-figure, but as the steady hand behind the idea of the shire itself—homes kept secure, families kept whole, and prosperity preserved through cooperation and quiet resilience.
