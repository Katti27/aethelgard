(c. –4122 to –3500)

### [[1.4.4 — Birth of the Dragonforged People (c. –4050)]]
(c. –4122 to –3500)
Dragonborn and kobolds are hatched through divine intervention; other rare lineages appear in scattered, isolated origins.

### [[1.4.5 — Gruumsh’s Children (c. –4000)]]
(c. –4000 to –3500)
Orcs and goblinoids are first shaped and set loose across **[[Wild Reaches]]** by their deity **[[Gruumsh, the One-Eye|Gruumsh]]**.

### [[1.4.6 — The Smallfolk (c. –3850)]]
(c. –3850 to –3500)
**Gnomes - Birth from Gems**: Gnomes believe they were originally formed from gems hidden deep within the earth. Different subraces came from different stones: rock gnomes from diamonds, forest gnomes from emeralds, and deep gnomes from rubies. The gnome deity [[Minor Deities of Aethelgard|Garl Glittergold]], the head of the gnome pantheon, found these gems and breathed life into them, causing them to open "like flowers" and release the first gnomes. This myth is the foundation for the gnomish love of gems and their urge to build homes underground.
**Halflings - The Mother/Creator Story**: In some traditions, [[Minor Deities of Aethelgard|Yondalla]], also known as the Provider and the Protector, directly gave birth to the first halflings. Their origins in this early period are still unclear, even to themselves.
Halfling shires form along rivers and gentle hills, while gnome enclaves develop near dwarven delves and regions of wild or experimental magic.

### [[1.4.7 — First Awakening of Humanity (c. –3800)]]
(c. –3800 to –3500)
Human tribes appear across temperate plains, river valleys, and coasts—small, scattered, and largely semi-nomadic.

### [[1.4.8 — Mighty People of Stronmaus (c. –3700)]]
(c. –3700 to –3500)
The first goliaths arise from humans of the northern foothills of **[[Durak-Throndhal, the Gods’ Anvil|Durak-Throndhal]]**, transformed by **[[Stronmaus, the Smiling God]]** after climbing the **[[Columns of the Sky]]** to seek the might of the giant gods.

### [[1.4.9 – Marked Bloodlines (c. –3550)]]
(c. –3550 to –3500)
Tieflings, aasimar, and other marked mortal bloodlines arise through pacts, curses, celestial favor, and planar influence, seeding future lineages across the world.

## [[1.5 — SCHISMS OF THE FIRST RACES (c. –3600 to –2500 BC)]]
### [[1.5.1 — Shadow Schism Begins (c. –3600)]]
c. –3600 to –3470
A bitter druidic rivalry and religious conflict fractures elven society; exiled elves flee into the deep caverns.

### [[1.5.2 — Rise of the Drow Realms (c. –3570)]]
(c. –3570 to –2000)
Exile communities in the depths transform into the first **drow** cities, bound to **Lolth, the Dark Mother**. They carve and claim a growing network of deep passages beneath mountains and lowlands. As the Era progresses a capital city named Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders, is founded and begins to take shape in the Underdark. It is built around Narbondel, an enormous stalagmite that functions as a clock for the entire city.

### [[1.5.3 — Enslavement of the Deep Clans (c. –3410)]]
(c. –3410 to –3325)
Illithids seize isolated dwarf delves in the deep underways; the ancestors of the **duergar** are taken as thralls. Illithid torment and experimentation twist captive dwarves into the grey-skinned duergar, who begin to serve elder brains.

### [[1.5.4 — Duergar Rebellion (c. –3325)]]
(c. –3325 to –3170)
**Divine Intervention:** Duergar legends state that their gods, Laduguer and Deep Duerra, were involved in their liberation.
    - [[Minor Deities of Aethelgard|Laduguer]] is credited with leading the revolt and purging the influence of other dwarven gods from their souls.
    - [[Minor Deities of Aethelgard|Deep Duerra]] is said to have stolen the power of psionics (mind magic) from the mind flayers and gifted it to her people.
**Psionic Abilities and Innate Magic:** Over generations of imprisonment, the Duergar absorbed strange magical power from the Underdark, which, combined with the stolen psionics, gave them unique abilities. They gained resistance to magic, illusions, and charm effects, as well as the ability to enlarge their size and become invisible.
**The Rebellion:** Armed with their new psionic resistance and abilities, the Duergar rose up in a bloody, successful rebellion and massacred their illithid masters.

### [[1.5.5 — Duergar Consolidation (c. –3170)]]
(c. –3170 to –2500)
The Duergar carve and claim an Empire of their own—growing networks of deep passages and fortified keeps. The illithids retreat to their colonies to lick their wounds and plot their revenge

## [[1.6 — Rise and Fall of the Dhakaani (c. –2500 to –1150)]]
### [[1.6.1 — The Fist of Gruumsh (c. –2500 to –2325)]]
Manifestation of the Avatar: **The Fist of Gruumsh**. In the deep places of the **Wild Reaches**, a monstrous presence rises—an embodiment of Gruumsh’s will made flesh. Word spreads first as rumor, then as omen: a god has _walked_ and demands tribute in blood. Warbands gather from scattered clans, drawn by fear, hunger, and the promise that the weak will be culled and the strong will be remade. The earliest years are not an empire but a fever—raids and slaughter sanctified as proof, self-mutilation and ritual scars as devotion, and brutal purges that turn desperate hosts into fanatics. Those who submit are folded into the growing tide; those who resist are made examples. By the end of this period, “Dhakaan” is no longer merely a cult—it is a name spoken like a warning across the plains and passes.

### [[1.6.2 — The Nine Blades and the Mark (c. –2325 to –2250)]]
The war-cult hardens into a **theocracy**. From within the chaos, war-priests seize control and impose structure: **The Nine Blades of the Eye**, led by the **First Blade**, proclaim that conquest requires more than frenzy—it requires obedience that does not break. They craft the cult’s central ritual to impose control: **the Mark of the One Eye**, a binding curse designed to turn unruly warbands into an army. The rite is simple, repeatable, and terrifying. Initiates are **hot-branded over the left eye** with the Mark of Gruumsh, then made to drink blood drawn from the Avatar as the **sealing draught** that binds the curse to flesh and spirit. Those who endure become “proved,” and those who fail are offered up as further devotion. The **Brandkeepers** are founded as priest-inquisitors and enforcers—keepers of the rite, judges of loyalty, and the hands that ensure the Mark remains a chain and not merely a scar. In this moment the Dhakaani are transformed: no longer only a horde that follows a monster, but a force that can build and hold power.

### [[1.6.3 — Founding Wars & Unification (c. –2250 to –1550)]]
The Empire of Dhakaani is forged across many generations, not in a single conquest but through relentless consolidation. Rival orc and goblin hosts are swallowed by treaty, terror, or annihilation; chieftains are broken and replaced; entire clans are marched under the Mark and folded into standardized musters. Forts rise at choke points and river crossings, and roads are built through the Wild Reaches as tools of rapid reinforcement—lines along which legions can move and levies can be enforced. Settlements follow, some voluntary, many forced: frontier hamlets turned into garrison-holds, camps that become permanent depots, and “marchlands” that are little more than feeding grounds for the war machine. Throughout it all, Brandkeepers stand behind banners and commanders alike, ensuring fear does what discipline alone cannot. By the end of this era, Dhakaan is an imperial engine—durable, replicable, and capable of projecting power far beyond the reach of any single warlord.

### [[1.6.4 — Expansion and the Wild Frontiers (c. –1550 to –1325)]]
Late acceleration begins at **–1550**. With the core territories secured, Dhakaani legions surge outward along hardened corridors—fort to fort, road to road—pushing the frontier like a moving blade-edge. The frontier is ruled through control of movement: hunting grounds, grazing routes, river fords, and seasonal camps are seized, watched, and turned into choke points. Borderlands are forced to feed garrisons and provide manpower through coercion and musters, while resistance is broken through burnings of winter stores, seizure of herds, taking of tools and livestock, and the driving off of those who refuse to submit.
It is in this phase that the Dhakaani collide with the wider world. Human kin-bands on the margins find old routes closed and sacred crossings watched; many scatter into harsher valleys and deeper forests, while others submit for a season and flee the next. Dwarves remain a distant presence—rarely seen in strength, more often encountered as lone wanderers, prospectors, guides, or small trading parties moving along foothills and passes. Some vanish into the hills and are never seen again; others return home with warnings and scars, carrying tales of branded hosts and a war-cult that marches like one body. The outer reaches of elven influence feel the pressure of roads and axes nearing sacred boundaries as Dhakaan clears lines of march and strips away cover. Dhakaan’s expansion spreads a method—**brand, bind, muster, and march**—until the frontiers become active fault lines and the Verdant Heart stands directly in the path of the empire’s hunger.

### [[1.6.5 — The Verdant War (c. –1325 to –1275)]]
Encroachment on the **Verdant Heart** sparks open war with elf druids. Dhakaan’s legions push into the green, but the conflict turns savage and asymmetric—ambushes in living terrain, vanishing trails, and a forest that seems to _move_ against them. Druid circles do not fight like an army: they harry supply lines with beasts and hidden archers, choke roads with sudden thickets and thorn walls, drown camps in rolling fog, and turn marches into nightmares of mud, roots, and exhaustion. Springs and streams are denied—bridges collapse, fords become impassable, and safe water is always “one ridge farther” as the land is reshaped to break momentum. Dhakaani commanders respond with terror discipline: the **Brandkeepers** increase use of the **Mark of the One Eye** to prevent retreats, force marches, and crush wavering warbands. Losses mount rapidly, and the war becomes a grinder that bleeds the empire’s strength faster than it can replace it. The Verdant War ends **abruptly in –1275**, not through a negotiated peace, but because the Dhakaani war-machine collapses at its source when the Mark’s control fails.

### [[1.6.6 — Luthic’s Plea and Uthgar’s Answer (c. –1300)]]
As the Verdant War devours clans and the Mark’s curse tightens into outright slavery, Luthic turns against Gruumsh’s waste. She does not seek mercy—she seeks survival and an end to the One Eye’s chains. Luthic reaches beyond the Dhakaani cult and calls to **[[Minor Deities of Aethelgard|Uthgar]]**, asking for strength that does not require bondage and frenzy. Uthgar answers by blessing a newborn beyond the Mark’s reach—an orc child unbranded by the rite and unbroken by the cult’s terror. The chosen one is **Zrogar Bloodfall** (Zrogar meaning Blade Champion), later remembered as **The Unscarred**—a figure of lawful strength who can challenge the Avatar directly and sever the curse at its source.

### [[1.6.7 — Zrogar Bloodfall, The Unscarred (c. –1275 to –1250)]]
In **–1275**, after decades of training and seeking, Zrogar confronts **The Fist of Gruumsh**. He invokes **Mak’gora**, the ancient orc rite of challenge recognized across the clans, and defeats the divine agent. With the Avatar’s death, the curse of the **Mark of the One Eye** collapses across the Dhakaani hosts: branded warriors feel the chain snap, Brandkeeper authority breaks overnight, and the empire’s command structure fractures into panicked splinters. The Verdant War ends that same year as Dhakaani forces lose cohesion and withdraw, flee, or turn on their overseers.
From **–1275 to –1250**, the conflict shifts inward. Orc and goblin warbands rise in rebellion and begin a brutal purge of remaining Dhakaani cultists—Brandkeepers, die-hard devotees of the One Eye, and any fort-garrisons that attempt to keep the old order. Former imperial troops become rival hosts; old grudges flare without the Mark to suppress them; and Zrogar’s authority is tested again and again as he tries to turn liberation into unity. This is the violent birth of the post-Dhakaani world: not a clean victory, but a tearing-away of chains and the war that follows when a terror-state loses its grip.

### [[1.6.8 — The Tribes of Zrogar (c. –1250 to –1150)]]
By **–1250**, the surviving clans formalize a new order under Zrogar’s banner: the **Tribes of Zrogar**. The capital city **Bloodfall** is founded and fortified as a permanent seat—part stronghold, part assembly-ground, and part symbol that the tribes will never again be ruled by a branded leash. In the wake of Dhakaan’s fall, the tribes embrace the **Code of Uthgar**—totemic rites and the Totemseers’ guidance—replacing cursed obedience with leadership proven in deed and upheld by clan law. The remainder of this period is defined by consolidation and recovery: rebuilding roads and settlements that were instruments of empire into lifelines for the tribes; hunting down Dhakaani remnants that refuse to die; mending relations (or at least establishing boundaries) with neighboring peoples; and founding new customary law. The Verdant Heart border cools into a tense ceasefire—both sides battered, both wary—while the Wild Reaches enter an age of uneasy rebuilding and new alliances.

## [[1.7 — AGE OF NEW BEGINNINGS (c. –1500 to –700 BC)]]
### [[1.7.1 — Great Human Migrations (c. –1500 to –1150)]]

In c. –653 the major trade town at the mouth of the Gatoria River is renamed Gucci in honor of the merchant Casa who founded it (and now also control it).

### [[1.8.2 — Ankaram before the Storm (c. –650 to –287)]]
 Very late in the Era genie-aligned patrons gain footholds through courts, shrines, and arcane bargains. Two Genasi arcanists — **Zafir al-'Asif**: "Victorious one of the storm," air genasi who relishes destruction, & **Sa'ir ad-Dunya** - "Blaze of the World", a power-hungry fire genasi, make preparations to assist elemental genies crossing into the mortal plane via interplanar portals where the fabric between the plane is thinnest.

### [[1.8.3 — Principalities of the Eastern Highlands (c. –650 to –287)]]

    - Builds a strong presence in Eldoria and Ankaram and becomes the **primary crusading order against the Blightwood Jungles**.
- **Scarlet Fist**
    - A militant order rooted in strict discipline and retribution.
    - Grows into Eldoria’s primary instrument for internal and border security.
    - Later becomes the lead force in **Chornyy Lis crusading / occupation**, not in the southern jungle crusades.

## [[1.11 — THE CRUSADE CYCLE (628 to 1073 AC)]]
### [[1.11.1 — First Crusade: Lanterns (628–677 AC)]]
- **Platinum Cadre**, sanctioned by the Eldorian Emperor and Senate, launches the **First Crusade into the southern jungles**.
- Goals:
    - map the corrupted regions,
    - establish fortified waystations,
    - test divine wards against the blight.
- They never directly identify Varthash, but their actions begin to constrain the spread of his influence.

### [[1.11.2 — The Moonshadow Plague & Scarlet Crusade (c. 650–900 AC)]]
- A surge in **lycanthropy** ravages **Chornyy Lis** and nearby regions.
- The **Scarlet Fist** leads a long campaign of suppression, quarantine, and occupation: the **Scarlet Crusade into Chornyy Lis**.
- By **660 AC**, the Scarlet Fist is fully mobilized there.
- The **Grand Duchy** is heavily constrained by Eldorian military presence.
- Vampires of the **Veiled Court** fight werewolves as rivals but remain no friends of the Scarlet Fist.

### [[1.11.3 — Second Crusade: Withering Dawn (862–909 AC)]]
- **LOCKED IN NAME & DATES**
- The **Second Crusade: Withering Dawn (862–909 AC)** is launched by the **Platinum Cadre** into the Blightwood Jungles.
- Deeper pushes into corrupted jungle; first serious clashes with powerful monstrosities and Shadow Druid factions.
- Crusaders still lack a clear picture of Varthash’s identity, facing only his symptoms and servants.

### [[1.11.4 — Third Crusade: Shattered Bough (1038–1073 AC)]]
- **Platinum Cadre** attempts a third major campaign to seize key jungle regions and permanently sanctify them.
- Fierce resistance from warped jungle, corrupted spirits, and Varthash’s broader network of minions.
- Campaign grinds down; forces are drawn away as tensions on the surface escalate toward the **Great War**.

## [[1.12 — THE GREAT WAR (1073–1138 AC)]]

A continent-spanning, multi-front conflict ignited by the collapse of Eldoria’s grip on Chornyy Lis, widened by steppe resentment, and made catastrophic by Underdark offensives and stormglass warfare.

### [[1.12.1 — Outbreak on Greengrass 1073 AC]]
- A coordinated uprising erupts across [[Chornyy Lis]] against [[Scarlet Fist]] rule.
- Scarlet Fist fortresses are destroyed in near-simultaneous strikes; survivors flee toward [[Eldorath]] and nearby bastions.
- The rebellion becomes the spark that turns simmering tensions into open war.

### [[1.12.2 — The Dark Court Slaughter (Midwinter 1074 AC)]]
- Drow and duergar erupt from the Underdark beneath eastern [[Thandralas]].
- Dwarven delvings and royal courts are devastated from below; high nobles, war-leaders, and priests are massacred in their own halls.
- In the wake of the slaughter, **Bhaal’s apotheosis** takes hold—murder elevated into sacrament, feeding the new god’s rise.

### [[1.12.3 — Escalation on All Fronts (1074–1088 AC)]]
- The war expands into a sprawling, multi-front struggle:
  - **Tripartite Alliance:** [[Eldoria]], [[Ankaram]], and [[Gatoria]] as the primary “order” bloc.
  - **Dhakaani-aligned bloc:** [[Batan]] and the re-mustered orc/goblinoid hosts (often framed as “Dhakaani legacy”), alongside Chornyy Lis’ anti-Eldorian alignment and Underdark offensives.
- **Stormglass** becomes a battlefield accelerant—rare, ruinously powerful, and politically destabilizing wherever it appears.
- The [[Mystran Accord]] remains officially neutral; Avonnar is kept shrouded, and the Accord’s involvement manifests through diplomacy, intelligence, and limited covert influence rather than open armies.

### [[1.12.4 — Bane’s Ascension (1089 AC)]]
- The Scarlet Fist’s highest leadership is shattered by the opening massacres and the widening war.
- Through infernal corruption and war-fed tyranny, **Bane ascends** as a secret god of conquest and domination—his worship forbidden, hidden, and interwoven into militant remnants.

### [[1.12.5 — The Dead Three Completed (1137 AC)]]
- **Bhaal** (murder), **Bane** (tyranny), and **Myrkul** (death) become a fully empowered triad of ascended gods—each fed by a different facet of the Great War.
- **Myrkul ascends in 1137 AC**, seizing the collapsing center of death-dominion as the slaughter reaches its peak.

### [[1.12.6 — Armistice & The Grand Concordance (Feast of the Moon, 1138 AC)]]
- Exhausted powers agree to an armistice rather than a clean victory.
- The peace settlement is formally styled **The Grand Concordance of Aethelgard** (often shortened to **The Grand Concordance**).
- Outcomes that define the modern world:
  - [[Chornyy Lis]] regains independence in name, but remains riddled with hidden cults and power-struggles.
  - Eastern [[Thandralas]] is permanently compromised—lost holds, monster-infested ruins, and open Underdark wounds.
  - [[Batan]] is forced into an Eldorian-leaning vassal posture, while preserving a strong internal identity.

> **Calendar note:** some diplomatic records mark the signing of the Grand Concordance as “Year 0” of a Concordance Era (CE). In this outline, the primary dating remains **A.C. (After Calamity)**, with Concordance Era treated as an optional overlay (1138 AC = 0 CE; 1191 AC = 53 CE).

## [[1.13 — THE POST-WAR TENSIONS (1138–1188 AC)]]

_(The “Scarred Century” after the Great War)_

### [[1.13.1 — Reconstruction & Rebordering]]
- Rebuilding occurs everywhere, but slowly: shattered cities, emptied holds, ruined farmlands, and displaced peoples.
- The great powers modernize infrastructure and doctrine (arcane, military, administrative), while simultaneously tightening borders.

### [[1.13.2 — Stormglass & the Black Market]]
- Stormglass transitions from rare wartime curiosity to a strategic commodity.
- Smuggling, sabotage, and theft intensify around deposits and caches; knowledge itself becomes contraband.

### [[1.13.3 — The Umbrali & the Underworld (post-1138 AC)]]
- The **[[Umbrali]]** syndicate rises as a dominant underworld force, especially in and around Gatorian trade hubs:
  - protection rackets and river control,
  - smuggling networks,
  - black-market circulation of stormglass and forbidden rites.

### [[1.13.4 — Corsairs of the Black Tide & Pirate Isles]]
- The **Corsairs of the Black Tide** become the most dangerous pirate confederation operating from the Pirate Isles.
- Sea-lanes remain unstable; “Pirate Kings” rise and fall, but the anarchy persists.

### [[1.13.5 — The Hidden Cults of the Dead Three]]
- **Bane:** infiltrates militant remnants and hardline political factions (including the shadow of the Scarlet Fist).
- **Bhaal:** murder-cults flourish in assassin circles and among some drow-aligned agents.
- **Myrkul:** spreads among necromancers, grave-cities, and those obsessed with stormglass and battlefields.

### [[1.13.6 — Shadow Druids Beyond the Jungle]]
- Corrupted druidic cells and death-cult circles begin operating outside the Blightwood sphere, bringing “southern corruption” into places that once considered themselves safe.

## [[1.14 — THE PRESENT ERA (1189–Greengrass 1191 AC)]]

_(The Opening of the Fourth Crusade)_

### [[1.14.1 — The Crusade of Returning Light (1189–1191 AC)]]
- Renewed pressure from the Blightwood and its undead horrors triggers a new formal campaign—often called **The Crusade of Returning Light**.
- Paladins and allied forces return to the southern frontier to secure approaches, reopen lines, and test whether the Blight can finally be pushed back.

### [[1.14.2 — Stormglass Thefts & Quiet War (late 1180s into 1190s)]]
- Systematic thefts of high-grade stormglass suggest coordinated conspirators rather than opportunistic criminals.
- Competing suspects include underworld syndicates, cults, and agents tied to the Blightwood’s unseen master.

### [[1.14.3 — Greengrass 1191 AC — Campaign Starting Point]]
- The calendar turns to **Greengrass 1191 AC**.
- The Fourth Crusade is underway, the Dead Three cults are active in the cracks of society, and the truth behind the Blightwood remains deliberately obscured to most of the world.
